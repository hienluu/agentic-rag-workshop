It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled \"Questioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\" was delivered by Sam Cox, CTO and Co-founder of Tracebit. The presentation discusses the strategic choice of using C# for startup development at Tracebit and outlines the benefits and experiences encountered in this decision.\n**Key Themes and Insights:**\n  * **Startup Challenges:** Initiating a startup involves competing with well-established companies with limited resources, necessitating a high level of productivity defined by focusing on activities that truly matter. Sam Cox shares his journey as a solo engineer navigating these challenges.\n  * **Adoption of C#:** In a field dominated by languages like Golang, TypeScript, and Python, Tracebit took a contrarian route by choosing C#. This was largely due to C#'s robust ecosystem, performance optimization, and familiarity with modern coding constructs.\n  * **Advantages of C#:** The decision to use C# was based on productivity gains through its rich suite of tools and features, which enabled rapid prototyping, feedback loops, and iteration. With C#, Sam was able to quickly build out essential components of their platform, allowing for real-time feedback and adjustments.\n  * **Unique Approach:** Sam employed a modular monolith strategy, allowing smooth orchestration of services within the application. This included using generic hosts and service orchestration to manage functionalities with minimal overhead.\n  * **Infrastructure and Performance:** The ability to easily iterate and adapt infrastructure configurations without extensive rewrite, as well as the use of batching and concurrency controls to address performance concerns, were key operational benefits.\n  * **Growth and Impact:** By leveraging C#, Tracebit grew from a solo-engineer startup to a team-oriented company, securing enterprise customers and funding. The talk emphasizes how strategic technology choices can strengthen startup velocity and product-market fit.\n\n\nThe presentation also included practical coding examples and Sam's reflections on the broader implications of choosing a less conventional programming language for startups, encouraging other entrepreneurs to consider varied technology stacks amidst industry norms.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nAre you considering founding a startup? What stack would you use? Would you take a bet on a programming language you've never used professionally before? When building a company from scratch, these aren\u2019t just theoretical questions \u2013 they\u2019re make-or-break decisions with real consequences.\nIn a situation where conventional wisdom might point to Golang, TypeScript or Python; Tracebit took a different - and potentially surprising - path by building in C#.\nSam, the CTO & Co-founder of Tracebit, will explore the rationale behind this decision and why it\u2019s been pivotal in enabling a small team to punch above their weight to win discerning enterprise customers in a competitive cybersecurity market. He\u2019ll tell the zero-to-one story of solo-engineering an MVP, landing our first enterprise customer, and growing a high-performing team through practical, in-the-trenches examples of how C# allows you to do more with less while scale increases and runway decreases.\nWhether you're launching a new venture or an engineering leader weighing technical tradeoffs, this session offers actionable insights for making technology decisions that serve both immediate needs and long-term vision \u2013 and how questioning the consensus about programming languages might be the strategic advantage you've been overlooking.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Sam Cox\nCo-Founder & CTO @Tracebit, Building Security Canaries at Scale\nSam is the CTO & Co-founder of Tracebit where he\u2019s building and scaling systems to automate the use of cloud-native infrastructure as Security Canaries to detect intrusions and insider risk in cloud environments.\nSam has spent over a decade designing and building critical software systems at scale, previously at Tessian where he architected resilient systems to handle high-volume email traffic for some of the world\u2019s largest enterprises using a shuffle-sharded, cell-based design.\nSam has previously presented cloud security research at fwd:cloudsec, revealing a now-patched technique to uncover the AWS account ID of private S3 buckets.\nRead more\n#####  Find Sam Cox at: \n  *   * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Sam Cox\nCo-Founder & CTO @Tracebit, Building Security Canaries at Scale\n#### Date\nTuesday Apr 8 / 10:35AM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nWindsor (5th Fl.)\n#### Track\nMemory Safe Native Languages and WASM\n#### Topics\nStartup C# .net security\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession services\n### Expanding Swift from Apps to Services\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST\nThe Swift programming language is a popular choice for applications, but many engineers are less familiar with Swift\u2019s capabilities for writing services. This session will explore why Swift is a great fit for services development, from memory safety to interoperability with other languages. \nCory Benfield\nSenior Software Engineer Doing Swift on Server @Apple\nExpanding Swift from Apps to Services\nSession WASM\n### WASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nTuesday Apr 8 / 01:35PM BST\nWebAssembly (WASM) is emerging as a powerful tool beyond its browser origins, enabling safer, more flexible, and more efficient execution across a wide range of enterprise applications.In this session, we\u2019ll take a hands-on look at real-world use cases, including: \nAndrea Peruffo\nOpen Source Addicted Software Developer @RedHat, Passionate About Distributed Systems, Compilers, Infrastructure and Everything In Between\nWASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nSession WebAssembly\n### How WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nTuesday Apr 8 / 02:45PM BST\nApplication extensions are an essential part of any software ecosystem. While Rust is a great language, its lack of a standard ABI means that the whole source code has to be available to the compiler. \nAlex Radovici\nOperating Systems & Compilers PhD, Author of \"Getting Started with Secure Embedded Systems\" and Core Contributor of Tock OS\nHow WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nSession\n### WASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nTuesday Apr 8 / 05:05PM BST\nWhy would you build your own Function as a Service platform and what does a FaaS architecture look like?
