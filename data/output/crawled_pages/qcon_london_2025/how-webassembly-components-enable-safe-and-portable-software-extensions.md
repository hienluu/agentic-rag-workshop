While Rust is a great language, its lack of a standard ABI means that the whole source code has to be available to the compiler. This makes writing shared libraries and software extensions in Rust almost impossible, unless they expose items through the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) or, in other words, the C ABI. Using FFI renders Rust's type and memory model useless. This talk will explore the ways in which WebAssembly Components can be used to build software extension in Rust avoiding the FFI and exposing rich data types and provide a safe memory mode. It will provide insights into several ways in which widely used Rust projects, such as Zed and Zellij have implemented extensions.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Alex Radovici\nOperating Systems & Compilers PhD, Author of \"Getting Started with Secure Embedded Systems\" and Core Contributor of Tock OS\nAlex Radovici, PhD. - specializes in Operating Systems and Compiler and is a core contributor to Tock OS.

What stack would you use? Would you take a bet on a programming language you've never used professionally before? When building a company from scratch, these aren\u2019t just theoretical questions \u2013 they\u2019re make-or-break decisions with real consequences. \nSam Cox\nCo-Founder & CTO @Tracebit, Building Security Canaries at Scale\nQuestioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\nSession services\n### Expanding Swift from Apps to Services\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST\nThe Swift programming language is a popular choice for applications, but many engineers are less familiar with Swift\u2019s capabilities for writing services. This session will explore why Swift is a great fit for services development, from memory safety to interoperability with other languages. \nCory Benfield\nSenior Software Engineer Doing Swift on Server @Apple\nExpanding Swift from Apps to Services\nSession WASM\n### WASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nTuesday Apr 8 / 01:35PM BST\nWebAssembly (WASM) is emerging as a powerful tool beyond its browser origins, enabling safer, more flexible, and more efficient execution across a wide range of enterprise applications.In this session, we\u2019ll take a hands-on look at real-world use cases, including: \nAndrea Peruffo\nOpen Source Addicted Software Developer @RedHat, Passionate About Distributed Systems, Compilers, Infrastructure and Everything In Between\nWASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nSession\n### WASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nTuesday Apr 8 / 05:05PM BST\nWhy would you build your own Function as a Service platform and what does a FaaS architecture look like? Building something that can scale to zero, work with your existing systems, stay secure, and handle different workloads isn\u2019t easy. \nLaurent Doguin\nDirector Developer Relations & Strategy @couchbase, Previously Developer Advocate @Clever Cloud and @Nuxeo\nWASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nSession\n### Unconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST\nUnconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\n"
