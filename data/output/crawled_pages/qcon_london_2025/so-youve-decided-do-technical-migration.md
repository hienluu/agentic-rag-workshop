Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled \"So You\u2019ve Decided To Do a Technical Migration\" by Sophie Koonin, a staff engineer at Monzo Bank, discusses the challenges and considerations involved in technical migrations, using Monzo\u2019s recent TypeScript migration as a case study.\n**Overview:**\n  * Migrations are complex and can often seem like a straightforward task that turns into an extended process filled with unforeseen challenges.\n  * The purpose is to share experiences from Monzo\u2019s migration to TypeScript and offer a toolkit for future migrations.\n\n\n**Key Challenges:**\n  * Migrations can be unpredictable due to unexpected problems and interruptions.\n  * It's crucial to balance organizational priorities against the migration effort.\n\n\n**Important Strategies:**\n  * _Incremental Approach_ : Conduct the migration in steps rather than all at once, especially when dealing with a large codebase, to reduce risks.\n  * _Tooling_ : Use scripting tools extensively to automate and manage parts of the migration.\n  * _Documentation_ : Maintain thorough documentation to keep everyone informed and aligned.\n  * _Stakeholder Communication_ : Clearly articulate the value and cost of the migration to gain necessary support.\n\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n  * Having a clearly defined rollback plan is vital, although Monzo sometimes proceeded without a backup due to the nature of the changes involved.\n  * Tooling is invaluable in eliminating manual steps and speeding up the process.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n  * Consider whether a migration is necessary and whether the potential benefits outweigh the effort.\n  * Be cautious of changing technologies and resist adopting new ones solely due to trends.\n\n\nSophie concludes with advice to thoroughly plan and consider the necessity of migration projects before starting, recognizing the real challenges they pose.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nIt seems like there\u2019s always a hot new library or framework promising great things. But people often forget about the pain and effort required to move from an old technology to a new one. How long will it take? If you finish, will it be worth it? And if you don\u2019t, could it leave you in a worse place than where you started?\nDrawing from my experience of the Typescript migration we recently completed at Monzo I\u2019ll take you through some of the different outcomes of technical migrations and the things we learned along the way, and leave you with a toolkit to tackle your next migration project.\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nI\u2019m primarily focussed on customer operations, building internal tooling to manage service and demand. I\u2019m also the Discipline Lead for web, which means making sure we\u2019re heading in the right direction and helping to establish a vision for where we want to be.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nI know that migrations are an inevitable part of working in software, and I wanted to share our lessons learned so that they might help others in the same position. I\u2019m also proud of what we achieved as a team, even if it wasn\u2019t super smooth sailing all the way through.\n### Who is your talk for?\nThis talk is for anyone who needs to effect change in the organisation - it\u2019s not just a technical talk, it\u2019s all about stakeholder management and navigating change. Even introducing a new piece of software or a new team process can require a level of buy-in and preparation that you might not have expected. \n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nI hope this talk provides people with a toolkit to use when they approach their next migration, so that they can make it as low-risk and low-friction as possible.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Sophie Koonin\nWeb Engineering Lead @Monzo, Writer, Speaker and Web 1.0 Enthusiast\nSophie is a staff engineer & web engineering lead at Monzo Bank, responsible for the web platform across the organisation and working on internal tooling that powers Monzo\u2019s award-winning customer service.
