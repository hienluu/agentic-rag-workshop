Here's a breakdown of the session:\n  * **Motivation:**\nThe motivation behind the talk was to address performance optimization challenges faced at work, prioritizing functionality over latest technologies.\n  * **Challenges and Strategies:**\n    * Leveraging _static analysis_ and tooling to detect patterns and facilitate large codebase migrations.\n    * Utilizing polyfill strategies for consistent experiences across legacy browsers.\n    * Applying techniques such as code splitting and virtualized rendering to enhance user experience.\n  * **Results:**\nThe introduction of optimizations led to significant performance improvements:\n    * Reduced bundle size by employing strategies like code splitting and replacing React with Preact, resulting in a 37% smaller bundle for modern browsers.\n    * Use of synthetic tests and Real User Monitoring (RUM) to gauge user experience improvements.\n  * **Future and Takeaways:**\n    * Continuous exploration of newer compression strategies and code optimization techniques.\n    * Understanding the internals of tools and building abstractions informed by past experiences.\n\n\nThe talk emphasized the importance of correlating business metrics with performance metrics, showing performance as a continuous improvement journey and addressing problems pragmatically.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nIn a world with a wide variety of network connections, any user can have a slow experience, and apps that delight users on fast connections can barely be usable on slow ones.\nIn this session, I'll share our journey of gradually adapting how we deliver pages to better cater to our users' constraints on an enterprise-scale platform with millions of sessions per month\u2014where simply rewriting everything from scratch is not an option.\nWith an eye on maintenance and scalability, we'll discuss:\n  * How to leverage static analysis and related tooling to detect patterns and conduct large codebase migrations.\n  * Different polyfill strategies to deliver the same experience in legacy browsers.\n  * How to use popular techniques like code splitting and virtualized rendering to optimize the User Experience.\n  * Results of using synthetic tests and Real User Monitoring (RUM) tooling to understand how visitors experience your application.\n\n\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Matheus Albuquerque\nStaff Software Engineer @Medallia, Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies, Programme Committee @React Summit US, Mentor @TechLabs, International Speaker, Technical Reviewer\nMatheus is a Staff Front-End Engineer at Medallia, building their surveys platform and helping them shape the customer experience market with React. He's also a Google Developer Expert specializing in Web Performance.\nHis areas of interest include React and its ecosystem, JavaScript and compile-to-JavaScript languages, Developer Experience, and perceived performance optimization.
