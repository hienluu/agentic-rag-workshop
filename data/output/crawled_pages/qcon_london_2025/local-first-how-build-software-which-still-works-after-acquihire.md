It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled **Local First \u2013 How To Build Software Which Still Works After the Acquihire** by Alex Good discusses the development of software that continues to function even after a company's acquisition, emphasizing the _local first_ approach.\n**Main Points:**\n  * The challenge with traditional networked software is its dependency on private server infrastructures, which users cannot control, risking obsolescence if the server is unavailable.\n  * _Local first software_ design principles prioritize the user's device as the primary source of truth, ensuring usability even when servers are unreachable.\n  * The speaker highlights the fragility of collaborative software due to its reliance on unique server-side applications, hindering scalability and user control over their own data.\n  * A generic infrastructure allowing applications to operate independently of proprietary servers is proposed, aiming for ease of repair and minimal user disruption.\n  * Using _Git_ as an analogy, the presentation suggests that local first software can enable constant progress, even offline, by allowing devices to sync directly without a dedicated server.\n  * Challenges like authentication, data synchronization, and schema management remain, but ongoing research suggests feasible solutions.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe local first approach to software development advocates for applications that empower users by allowing continued functionality independent of centralized server control, ultimately aiming for a more user-resilient software ecosystem.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nMuch of the software we use derives its value from being networked, sometimes that's about being able to use software on many devices, often it's about being able to collaborate with other people. This has enabled enormous productivity improvements and made us all more flexible, but it has a cost. The networked part of these applications is almost always inside a private entity, which means if that entity goes away - maybe it's acquired by a competitor, or just decides you aren't worth the money, or any of a hundred other things which we've all seen happen - then the people who derive value from the software are left with a useless app.\nHow could we make it possible for users to repair these broken apps? I'll describe how a set of design principles called \"local first\" enables us to build networked software which can outlive the companies that created it. We'll explore the current state of the technologies which enable this approach, and also some of the open problems and the opportunities which are arising in a world increasingly wary of depending on large corporate networks.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Alex Good\nSoftware Engineer @Ink & Switch, Core Contributor on the Automerge CRDT Library\nAlex Good works full time as a maintainer of the open source Automerge library. He spent a large chunk of his career building and maintaining distributed systems of ever increasing levels of complexity. One day, he decided that he couldn't face writing another server in order to ship bytes from his phone to a data centre in another city and then back to his laptop and so he started working on generic open source sync protocols.\nRead more\n#### Speaker\n##### Alex Good\nSoftware Engineer @Ink & Switch, Core Contributor on the Automerge CRDT Library\n#### Date\nMonday Apr 7 / 01:35PM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nWhittle (3rd Fl.)\n#### Track\nPerformance and Sustainability in Practice: How to Make Software Greener\n#### Topics\narchitecture CRDT database\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession green software\n### Beyond Uptime: What the 'Metric' Is Going On with Green Software?\nMonday Apr 7 / 02:45PM BST\nMetrics such as availability and latency have long been the cornerstones of software engineering.
