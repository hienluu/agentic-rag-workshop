It shapes how we work, how we connect, and the products we create. Yet, culture often feels like an intangible, immovable force beyond our control. What if that perception is wrong? What if every individual, regardless of their role or seniority, could meaningfully influence their company's culture and create an environment where teams thrive?\nIn this talk, I will draw on my experiences across diverse organizations \u2014 ranging from a global tech corporation to fast-paced startups, from in-office teams to fully remote environments. I will share experiences and insights into how diversity in lived experiences, thinking, and knowledge directly impacts not only team dynamics but also the quality of the products we deliver.\nKey takeaways include:\n  * Defining and nurturing culture: How to identify what works for your team and why a one-size-fits-all approach fails.\n  * Diversity and inclusion: How to recognize and leverage diversity beyond traditional metrics to enhance team effectiveness.\n  * Actions independent of seniority: Practical strategies for fostering cultural growth through both macro-level initiatives (e.g. hiring practices) and micro-level actions (e.g. everyday team interactions).\n  * Remote and hybrid dynamics: You will gather techniques to identify the unique challenges and opportunities of cultivating a positive culture in remote and hybrid work environments.\n\n\nAttendees will leave with actionable ideas they can implement within a week to start shaping a culture that works \u2014 not just because it feels right, but because it drives better outcomes for teams and businesses alike.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Natan \u017dabkar Nordberg\nEngineering Manager @topi, Focused on People and Team Leadership in Startups, Larger Companies, Remote, and In-Office Work\nNatan has always embraced his inner geek and nerd, first diving into programming by getting a floppy disk with the official C documentation and compiler - an adventure that taught him a lot about how to write broken code. With a career as varied as it is passionate, Natan has taught at a university, founded an extracurricular programming club, explored the world of improv theatre both on and off stage (actor, mentor, light and music technician), and studied theoretical mathematics before finding histrue calling in the tech industry as a software engineer focused equally on technical and soft skills.\nNatan\u2019s professional journey spans freelancing, working at bigger companies and thriving in startups, giving him a well-rounded perspective on different work environments and team dynamics. For the past seven years, he has deepened his focus on people through team leadership and management, while staying closely connected to technical work - making him especially appreciate the dynamic, collaborative nature of startups.\nOutside of work, Natan is a fan of board games, video games, and fantasy books. A fun fact: everyone in his immediate family holds a different passport.\nRead more\n#####  Find Natan \u017dabkar Nordberg at: \n  * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Natan \u017dabkar Nordberg\nEngineering Manager @topi, Focused on People and Team Leadership in Startups, Larger Companies, Remote, and In-Office Work\n#### Date\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nWhittle (3rd Fl.)\n#### Track\nBuilding a Culture that Works\n#### Topics\nbuilding culture management empowering employees\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession\n### Panel: Building a Culture that Works\nTuesday Apr 8 / 05:05PM BST\nIt\u2019s Everyone\u2019s Responsibility To Build a Great Culture\u2014How Do You Do It? \nPanel: Building a Culture that Works\nSession culture\n### Beyond the Code: Hiring for Cultural Alignment\nTuesday Apr 8 / 01:35PM BST\nTechnical interviews typically focus on coding skills, but cultural alignment is equally crucial for team success. \nAlicia Collymore\nSenior Engineering Manager @Incident.io, Dedicated to Leading Teams That Deliver Impactful Software\nBeyond the Code: Hiring for Cultural Alignment\nSession leadership\n### Achieving a Culture That Works: Inclusive Leadership that Drives Lasting Success\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST\nJoin Matthew as he explores the essential role of inclusive leadership in building high-trust, resilient, and engaged teams.
