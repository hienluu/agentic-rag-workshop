Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in open-source components, CI/CD pipelines, and automated engineering processes, exposing organizations to significant risks. Resilience in this context demands a shift from reactive defenses to proactive strategies that integrate security directly into engineering workflows, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed before they can be exploited.\n* * *\n### From this track\nSession\n### Secure by Design: Building Security into Engineering Workflows and Teams\nTuesday Apr 8 / 10:35AM BST\nSecurity doesn't have to be a blocker- it can be an enabler.
