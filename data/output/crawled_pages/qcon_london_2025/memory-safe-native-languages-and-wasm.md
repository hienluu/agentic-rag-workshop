With modern languages that compile to native code, it's possible to write efficient code, both in terms of clock cycles as well as memory usage. We'll look at the state of modern languages in the industry.\nAnother approach to ensure memory safety is isolation, a particular strength of WebAssembly. WebAssembly is increasingly used to run code in low overhead sandboxes that don't incur the costs of other sandboxing methods while still offering strong isolation. We'll look at the state of WebAssembly for this purpose as well as real world uses.\n* * *\n### From this track\nSession Startup\n### Questioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\nTuesday Apr 8 / 10:35AM BST\nAre you considering founding a startup? What stack would you use? Would you take a bet on a programming language you've never used professionally before? When building a company from scratch, these aren\u2019t just theoretical questions \u2013 they\u2019re make-or-break decisions with real consequences. \nSam Cox\nCo-Founder & CTO @Tracebit, Building Security Canaries at Scale\nQuestioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\nSession services\n### Expanding Swift from Apps to Services\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST\nThe Swift programming language is a popular choice for applications, but many engineers are less familiar with Swift\u2019s capabilities for writing services. This session will explore why Swift is a great fit for services development, from memory safety to interoperability with other languages. \nCory Benfield\nSenior Software Engineer Doing Swift on Server @Apple\nExpanding Swift from Apps to Services\nSession WASM\n### WASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nTuesday Apr 8 / 01:35PM BST\nWebAssembly (WASM) is emerging as a powerful tool beyond its browser origins, enabling safer, more flexible, and more efficient execution across a wide range of enterprise applications.In this session, we\u2019ll take a hands-on look at real-world use cases, including: \nAndrea Peruffo\nOpen Source Addicted Software Developer @RedHat, Passionate About Distributed Systems, Compilers, Infrastructure and Everything In Between\nWASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nSession WebAssembly\n### How WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nTuesday Apr 8 / 02:45PM BST\nApplication extensions are an essential part of any software ecosystem. While Rust is a great language, its lack of a standard ABI means that the whole source code has to be available to the compiler. \nAlex Radovici\nOperating Systems & Compilers PhD, Author of \"Getting Started with Secure Embedded Systems\" and Core Contributor of Tock OS\nHow WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nSession\n### Unconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST\nUnconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\nSession\n### WASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nTuesday Apr 8 / 05:05PM BST\nWhy would you build your own Function as a Service platform and what does a FaaS architecture look like? Building something that can scale to zero, work with your existing systems, stay secure, and handle different workloads isn\u2019t easy. \nLaurent Doguin\nDirector Developer Relations & Strategy @couchbase, Previously Developer Advocate @Clever Cloud and @Nuxeo\nWASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\n#### Track Host\n##### Werner Schuster\nKernel Developer @Wolfram, InfoQ Editor Functional Programming\n#### Date\nTuesday Apr 8 / 10:35AM BST \n#### Share\nShare Share\n### Track Host\n#### Werner Schuster\nKernel Developer @Wolfram, InfoQ Editor Functional Programming\nWerner Schuster (@murphee) sometimes writes software, sometimes writes about software.
