It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \n**Summary of 'Empowering Teams: Decentralizing Architectural Decision-Making' Presentation**\n**Speakers:** Peter Hunter and Elena Stojmilova\n**Key Points:**\n  * _Problem Identification:_ The transition began during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to re-architect a legacy system into a modern cloud-native SaaS platform.\n  * _Teams and Tools:_ The organization created multiple product engineering teams, supported by enabling and platform teams. Architectural decisions were decentralized using tools like Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and an Architectural Advisory Forum (AAF).\n  * _Architectural Principles:_ Clear architectural principles were established to align with business strategy, guiding the decision-making process across teams.\n  * _Advice Process:_ Any team could make decisions after seeking advice from relevant parties and recording decisions publicly. This ensured transparency and accountability.\n  * _Implementation Stages:_ Teams went through phases from not realizing their decision-making autonomy to actively proposing new technologies and practices.\n  * _Challenges and Reflection:_ Implementing the system had challenges such as transitioning from a centralized decision-making model and dealing with the legacy system's complexities.\n\n\n**Benefits:**\n  * Enhanced trust and transparency within teams.\n  * Improved alignment with business strategies, reducing release cycles.\n  * Empowered teams with ownership over their projects, leading to stronger architectural decisions.\n\n\n**Conclusion:** Decentralizing architectural decision-making can significantly improve organizational innovation and agility by empowering teams and utilizing structured processes like ADRs and AAFs.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving tech landscape, centralised architectural decision-making can become a bottleneck to delivery performance and innovation. Through stories from our own journey, we\u2019ll share how decentralising decisions improved alignment across teams, empowered faster decision-making, and fostered a culture of ownership. We'll share lessons learned implementing lightweight governance, defining clear architectural guardrails through architectural principles, and the tools to support decentralised decisions.\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nTo lead the development of a scalable SaaS platform, through guiding, mentoring, and empowering our teams.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nSharing our experiences of embracing change through autonomous, empowered teams and decentralized architectural decision-making has transformed our processes and improved our ability to deliver value. By discussing the challenges we\u2019ve faced and the strategies we\u2019ve developed, we hope to inspire others who are navigating similar transitions.\n### Who is your talk for?\nArchitects and Engineers looking to scale the practice of architecture or looking for an alternative to \"Ivory Tower\" architecture.\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nAn understanding of how they can use Architectural Principles, Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and create an advice forum for decision-making. Inspiring them to try a new approach to the practice of architecture.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nThe obvious answer is AI, but we're specifically interested in legacy modernization and keeping platforms current.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Peter Hunter\nHead of R&D, Tech Architect @OpenGI, Led the Transformation of a Legacy Solution Into a Modern Cloud-Based SaaS Platform\nA technology leader with 25+ years of experience in the Insurance industry, Peter led the transformation of a legacy solution into a modern cloud-based SaaS platform, significantly improving scalability and performance and allowing teams to unlock the benefits of cloud.
