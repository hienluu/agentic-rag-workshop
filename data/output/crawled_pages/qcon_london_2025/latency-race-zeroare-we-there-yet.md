It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled _'Latency: The Race to Zero...Are We There Yet?'_ by Amir Langer focuses on the significance of latency in financial trading systems and explores methods to achieve low latency in distributed systems. The talk delves into historical and modern techniques used to reduce latency, emphasizing their application in mission-critical trading systems.\n**Key Topics Discussed:**\n  * **Importance of Low Latency:** In the fintech industry, lower latency can directly translate to financial gains by enabling faster transaction execution and better pricing strategies.\n  * **Predictable Latency:** Consistency in latency is crucial, as unpredictable delays can impact system recovery and responsiveness, leading to unavailability.\n  * **Historical Context:** The talk touches on the evolution of communication systems from the Roman Empire's cursus publicus to the Pony Express and the telegraph, highlighting advancements made to reduce latency in message delivery.\n\n\n**Technical Insights:**\n  * **Complexity of Modern Systems:** The design of modern processors involves complex caching layers and shared memory, which must be managed effectively to reduce latency.\n  * **Strategies for Low Latency:** Techniques such as separation of concerns and asynchronous processing with state machines can optimize message handling and reduce delays in distributed systems.\n  * **Advanced Methodologies:** The presentation discusses future-oriented projects like Aeron, which utilize kernel bypass and direct interfacing with network hardware to achieve extremely low latency.\n\n\nThe presentation concludes by highlighting the ongoing race to reduce latency further, leveraging both historical lessons and cutting-edge technology to push the boundaries of what's achievable in system performance.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nLow and predictable latency have been an edge in financial trading. Aeron has been pushing the limit on what is possible for IPC, on-premise, and in the cloud messaging. Can we do better? Reaching back into computer science history, techniques like Virtual Synchrony can be used to, not only reduce latency, but also provide high-availability and avoid the complexity of distributed concurrency. In this talk we will explore an approach for system composition that some financial organizations use to give an edge when building mission critical systems.\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nI work on a future product called Aeron Sequencer at Adaptive.\nIt is based on the cluster available in the open source Aeron project that allows teams to design and build trading systems with low and predictable latency.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nExploring ideas at the heart of distributed systems such as Virtual synchrony, Sequencer and state machine composition. Also asking \"why?\" quite a lot.\n### Who is your talk for?\nDevelopers, architects, anyone who likes to ask \"why?\", take a wider view and think about system design as part of the solution, not just a constraint.\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nUnderstand how (and why) key concepts from distributed systems design can be used to improve latency metrics.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nYes, I also think the next big disruption is AI but not in the same dark scary way it is often described.\nThe ability for AI to do the simple, \"solved\", boring stuff well, means we will be forced to do a much better job of separating concerns and domain design.\nWe will need to design more modular solutions and do better at protocol and API design, in order to use AI to our advantage.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Amir Langer\nPrincipal Software Engineer @Adaptive Financial Consulting\nAmir has been enjoying the challenges of software development for the past 30 years.\nHis career started with an MSc in computer science, then moved to software engineering roles (using Java since its first release), focusing on large scale distributed and high-performance low latency systems. In the finance domain, Amir was the first developer at LMAX exchange and a team lead for many years. Now he is a principal developer at Adaptive, the home of Aeron, collaborating on future Aeron products.\nRead more\n#####  Find Amir Langer at: \n  *   * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Amir Langer\nPrincipal Software Engineer @Adaptive Financial Consulting\n#### Date\nWednesday Apr 9 / 11:45AM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nMountbatten (6th Fl.)\n#### Track\nThe Tech of FinTech\n#### Topics\narchitecture aeron performance sequencer\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession\n### The Way We Manage Compliance Is Wrong\u2026 And Is Changing!
