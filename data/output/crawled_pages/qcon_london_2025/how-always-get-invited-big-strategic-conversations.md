Early on in our careers, we focus on technical depth and excellence. Yet for most of us, our career stalls around limited opportunities to demonstrate strategic thinking and business impact, not a lack of technical depth.\nThis talk will focus on practical strategies and examples for getting invited to the big conversations where strategic decisions are made and projects are assigned. You\u2019ll learn how to be the default choice across the company to represent engineering on specific topics, how to demonstrate you\u2019re capable of taking the next step in your career when it isn\u2019t technical skill holding you back and how to share these skills with others to build a strong product-focused company.\n### **Key takeaways:**\n  * How to identify topics of high strategic importance your peers and team aren\u2019t aware of.\n  * How to become recognised as a topic expert within the business on non-technical and partially technical things.\n  * How to make sure when you do get in the room, you\u2019re invited back a second time. And then are chosen to lead the projects and teams you really want to lead.  \n\n\n\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Mark Allen\nEngineering Leader and Technical Co-Founder, Over 10 Years Experience Growing Managers and Senior Engineers\nMark Allen is Head of Engineering at Isometric, one of the UK's fastest growing climate tech companies.
