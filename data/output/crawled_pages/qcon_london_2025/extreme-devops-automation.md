This approach allows a 15-person DevOps team to support 1300 engineers and manage 6500 deployments. This efficiency is critical to ensuring teams focus on innovation rather than the complexities of infrastructure and tool configuration.\n**Key Points:**\n  * Revolut's rapid growth leverages a vast microservices architecture, making automation essential to managing the complexity of thousands of engineers and product teams.\n  * The DevOps platform team at Revolut employs strategies to support a massive number of deployments, enhancing efficiency and focus on product innovation.\n  * A system called Tower acts as a developer portal, helping engineers handle deployments efficiently through well-defined patterns and automation.\n  * The focus is on automation, reducing manual configuration needs and enabling self-service for engineering teams.\n\n\n**Challenges and Solutions:**\n  * Managing a large-scale system involves challenges like the need for a consistent tooling experience and efficient resource management.\n  * Automation allows for the rapid deployment and configuration of necessary resources, minimizing dependencies on manual operations.\n  * Efforts towards creating a zero-configuration setup to further ease the engineering workflow were emphasized.\n\n\n**Conclusion:** By focusing on automation and standardization, Revolut effectively allows its development teams to concentrate on innovation, maintaining the company's competitive edge in the fintech industry.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nRevolut's rapid growth relies on a powerful microservices architecture, but this presents a significant scaling challenge. Thousands of engineers and hundreds of product teams, configuring the underlying tooling and infrastructure for each service \u2013 from git workspaces and CI/CD pipelines to Kubernetes deployments and monitoring dashboards \u2013 can be a huge waste. How does Revolut ensure that teams are focus on innovation? This talk dives into how Revolut tackles this challenge head-on. We'll explore the extreme automation strategies employed by a lean, 15-person DevOps platform team to support 1300 engineers and manage a staggering 6500 deployments, enabling Revolut to deliver a truly \"Wow\" experience and keeping Revolut at the forefront of fintech innovation.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### S\u00e9rgio Amorim\nSystems Engineering @Revolut, Working in Developer Experience DevOps Platform Team\nS\u00e9rgio is a software engineer with a 20-year journey through the IT world, and is currently leading the DevOps Platform Developer Experience team at Revolut.
