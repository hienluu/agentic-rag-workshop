Traditional observability tools are insufficient for Netflix's media workflows which require a scalable approach that supports asynchronous tasks. To address these challenges, Netflix developed a stream-processing pipeline for enhanced observability, transforming operations from reactive troubleshooting to proactive decision-making.\n**Key Strategies:**\n  * **Near Real-time Insights:** Implementing quick event processing to identify errors promptly and reduce wasted compute resources.\n  * **Optimal Rollup Strategies:** Consolidating millions of low-level events into actionable business insights through pre-aggregation and event collapsing.\n  * **Opinionated Tagging Taxonomy:** Establishing a consistent tagging system to ensure consistent expression of business metrics.\n  * **Enabling ROI Analysis:** Facilitating deeper analysis of compute usage and latency impacts to optimize feature development strategies.\n\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n  * The observability platform utilizes domain-specific events, distributed tracing, and consistent tagging for a comprehensive view of workloads.\n  * A stream-processing pipeline processes billions of events in real-time for rapid insights and on-the-fly aggregations.\n\n\n**Challenges and Solutions:**\n  * Handling the complexity and volume of trace spans and microservice calls requires improved trace processing and visualization strategies.\n  * Efforts include introducing a request ID for better tracking and optimizing data storage and retrieval for faster execution graph loading.\n  * Custom visualization and stream processing techniques are employed to manage scalability and enhance real-time analytics capabilities.\n\n\n**Future Outlook:**\nThe team aims to integrate connected data insights across the media production lifecycle, from initial pitch to streaming, and continue enhancing observability capabilities to support business decision-making and infrastructure scalability.\n_Conclusion:_ By adopting sophisticated observability strategies, Netflix enhances its ability to manage large-scale media workflows more effectively and efficiently, driving business value through improved operational insights.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nManaging media workflows at the Netflix scale is both thrilling and daunting. With millions of workflow executions across hundreds of types and over 500 million CPU hours consumed quarterly, costs can skyrocket, and encoding issues can disrupt the streaming experience. The challenge is immense: ensuring the timely delivery of high-resolution encodes, avoiding costly codec bugs, supporting last-moment redeliveries, and identifying bottlenecks before they drain compute resources. How do we navigate this complex system without spiraling into budget and delay disasters? This isn't just about fixing bugs faster anymore. This is connected to observability driving real business value. Imagine instantly knowing the true cost of encoding each movie, or precisely tracking redelivery metrics that directly impact revenue.\nWe confronted these challenges directly and discovered that traditional observability tools, designed primarily for RPC-style services, were inadequate for media workflows. We required observability at scale to support asynchronous media workflows with long-running tasks. By embracing domain-specific events, distributed tracing, and consistent tagging, we achieved a comprehensive view of our users' workloads. We developed a stream-processing pipeline that processes events from various parts of media workflows and collates them into actionable insights. This powers our observability platform, capable of handling billions of events in real-time, enabling rapid insights and on-the-fly aggregations.\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll cover the following aspects of how we built observability for long-running, distributed, and high-throughput systems, and how you can apply these learnings:\n  * **Near real-time insights** : Learn how to process events promptly to meet the monitoring needs of low-latency encoding. Discover techniques to enable users to catch bugs sooner, limiting wasted compute on encodes known to fail.\n  * **Optimal rollup strategies:** Explore how to consolidate millions of low-level events into hundreds of business insight events. We'll share techniques like pre-aggregation and event collapsing to minimize storage and efficiently support top queries.\n  * **Opinionated tagging taxonomy:** Understand the importance of a defined tagging taxonomy and how it ensures all business metrics are expressed consistently within your observability platform.\n  * **Enabling ROI analysis for feature development:** See how to facilitate long-pole analysis, gain insights into compute usage, and understand latency implications for better ROI analysis of your feature development.\n\n\nBy the end of this session, attendees will have concrete strategies to implement effective observability, transforming operations from reactive firefighting to proactive decision-making. Get ready to move from panic to clear, actionable insights, bringing clarity and control to your own large-scale systems!\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Sujana Sooreddy\nSoftware Engineer @Netflix - Building High Scale Observability Solutions\nSujana Sooreddy is a software engineer specializing in distributed and asynchronous processing systems at scale.

Ever feel like you're swimming in dashboard soup? You know the feeling: tons of single-use dashboards, building new ones during every incident only to lose them in the chaos, and spending ages creating visualizations that no one ever looks at again. \nMartha Lambert\nProduct Engineer @incident.io, Building Reliable and Observable Systems\nFrom Dashboard Soup to Observability Lasagna: Building Better Layers\nSession APIs\n### Scaling API Independence: Mocking, Contract Testing & Observability in Large Microservices Environments\nWednesday Apr 9 / 01:35PM BST\nMicroservices promise faster deployments and team autonomy.
