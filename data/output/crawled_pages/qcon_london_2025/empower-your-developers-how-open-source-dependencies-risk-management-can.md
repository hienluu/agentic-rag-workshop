It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled \"Empower Your Developers: How Open Source Dependencies Risk Management Can Unlock Innovation\" by Celine Pypaert focuses on effectively managing open source dependencies to drive innovation while balancing security risks. Below is a structured summary:\n**Introduction**\nThe session addresses the challenge of managing security in open source dependencies and how it impacts innovation. The speaker introduces the concept with analogies about building strong and stable foundations.\n  * _Importance of Foundations:_ Just like a stable building requires a strong foundation, software applications need a secure base to build upon.\n  * _Role of Security:_ Security should be seen as a blueprint to facilitate secure innovation, especially against increasing cyber threats.\n\n\n**Key Strategies**\n  * **Identification:** Recognize and understand the open source components in your environment to manage them effectively.\n  * **Ownership and Accountability:** Ensure clear ownership to maintain and secure dependencies, preventing orphaned repositories.\n  * **Proactivity:** Shift from reactive firefighting to proactive management through automation and strategic approaches.\n  * **Prioritization:** Use tools like Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities for prompt remediation.\n\n\n**Tools and Best Practices**\n  * **Software Bill of Materials (S-bomb):** Implement S-bombs for transparency in dependency management and compliance with regulations.\n  * **Engagement with Teams:** Leverage internal teams like security, IT, and data protection for comprehensive risk management strategies.\n  * **Automation Tools:** Integrate tools like Dependabot and Black Duck for efficient vulnerability tracking and management.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n  * **Cultural Change:** Emphasize the importance of security culture within organizations to ensure long-term resilience and innovation.\n  * **Continuous Improvement:** Adopt a continuous cycle of monitoring and updating practices to address emerging security challenges.\n\n\nThe presentation concludes with practical steps and encourages ongoing collaboration between teams to foster a secure and innovative development environment.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nAs security practitioners, we face the challenge of driving innovation whilst needing to balance security risks. This talk explores how to overcome this challenge by managing Open Source dependencies more effectively, automating patching, and establishing better security policies and processes to help teams harness the power of Open Source more securely.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Celine Pypaert\nVulnerability Manager @Johnson Matthey, Women in CyberSecurity UK Volunteer, Book Contributor, Ex-Microsoft\nCeline is Security Vulnerability Manager at Johnson Matthey, a global leader in sustainable technologies manufacturing. They were previously a Security Technical Specialist at Microsoft UK and security presales engineer at VMware. \nCeline successfully achieved a career-switch - going from manual and service work into cybersecurity by self-teaching for years, later earning a Computer Science degree.  \nCeline is now in their second cyber leadership role, blending technical knowledge and cyber strategy with deep people collaboration, to collectively align with and achieve business objectives.\nA big believer in giving back to the community, Celine is passionate about helping marginalised people get into or progress in STEAM, volunteering with Stemettes, Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) UK & Ireland, and Alliances Global. They also helped co-found Microsoft's first Social Mobility ERG (Employee Resource Group).\nRead more\n#####  Find Celine Pypaert at: \n  * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Celine Pypaert\nVulnerability Manager @Johnson Matthey, Women in CyberSecurity UK Volunteer, Book Contributor, Ex-Microsoft\n#### Date\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nMountbatten (6th Fl.)\n#### Track\nResilient Engineering Practices for Security Against Modern Threats\n#### Topics\nopen source supply chain risk vulnerability management software devellopment\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession security\n### Securing AI Assistants: Strategies and Practices for Protecting Data\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST\nThe data behind AI copilots is not only their most critical asset but also a key strategic consideration for enterprises and SMBs alike. \nAndra Lezza\nOWASP London Chapter Leader, 10+ Years of Experience Building AppSec Program\nSecuring AI Assistants: Strategies and Practices for Protecting Data\nSession software supply chain\n### Trust No One: Securing the Modern Software Supply Chain with Zero Trust\nTuesday Apr 8 / 01:35PM BST\nCan you truly trust your software supply chain?
