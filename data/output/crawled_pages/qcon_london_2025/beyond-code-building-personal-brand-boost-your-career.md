Platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter, along with active engagement in communities, open up unique pathways for senior developers and technical leaders to elevate their professional profiles, build influence, and expand their career options beyond the codebase. In this presentation, Roland Meertens and Steef-Jan Wiggers will reflect on their own career journeys, sharing what they tried to increase their visibility and opportunities in the job market\u2014and, most importantly, what worked.\nThe session will explore actionable strategies for harnessing social media to establish a technical presence, and effectively contributing to open-source projects to enhance both personal growth and industry credibility. You\u2019ll discover tips for writing blog articles that share insights and establish thought leadership. We\u2019ll also cover the role of helping others, such as mentoring or contributing to Q&A sites, to expand your network and sharpen your own skills.\nFinally, we'll dive into practical ways to contribute to industry-leading communities like QCon and InfoQ\u2014through news pieces, in-depth articles, or even podcasts\u2014that allow you to give back to the developer ecosystem while raising your own professional profile. This session will equip you with a range of tools and techniques to grow your career by expanding your influence beyond code, connecting with others in the industry, and building a legacy that can be your ticket to future opportunities.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Roland Meertens\nInfoQ Editor, Machine Learning Engineer @Wayve, Previously @Bumble Inc, @Annotell, and @Autonomous Intelligent Driving\nRoland is a ML Engineer working on Computer Vision for self driving cars.
