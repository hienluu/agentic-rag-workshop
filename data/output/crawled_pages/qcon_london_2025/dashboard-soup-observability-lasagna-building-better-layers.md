It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled \"_From Dashboard Soup to Observability Lasagna: Building Better Layers_ \" by Martha Lambert focuses on transforming chaotic observability systems into structured, reliable layers.\n**Key Points:**\n  * **Problem Identification:** Dashboard soup is characterized by numerous single-use dashboards created during incidents and quickly forgotten, leading to inefficiencies.\n  * **Observability Strategy:** Emphasizes layered observability, transforming the system into a structured \"lasagna\" consisting of overview dashboards, system dashboards, logs, and traces. This layered approach facilitates seamless navigation through incidents, allowing engineers to pinpoint issues efficiently.\n  * **Importance of Connectivity:** Ensures layers are interconnected, providing a clear path for engineers from high-level overviews to detailed debugging information. This is achieved by implementing intuitive links and clear navigation paths between different observability layers.\n  * **Cultural Change:** Promotes a culture shift towards making observability an integral part of system reliability. Involves engaging the team through hands-on exercises and drills to foster a sense of ownership and familiarity with the tooling.\n\n\nThe talk provides practical insights into creating a robust observability framework that enhances system reliability and engineer confidence, ultimately allowing teams to manage incidents with greater assurance and efficiency.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nLet's be honest - observability can suck. Ever feel like you're swimming in dashboard soup? You know the feeling: tons of single-use dashboards, building new ones during every incident only to lose them in the chaos, and spending ages creating visualizations that no one ever looks at again. Even with all the right tools, something still feels off.\nThis talk shares the journey of how our team tackled this exact problem while building an on-call tool with high expectations for reliability. You'll hear how we went from feeling lost in our own tooling to becoming confident enough to sleep soundly while on-call. Through building clear system boundaries, a thoughtful approach to dashboards, and running hands-on drills with our team, our observability approach became the key thing that makes our system feel reliable.\n#### Key takeaways include:\n  * Principles for building dashboards that are useful, long lived, and widely adopted\n  * How to layer your stack, by connecting your observability tooling to build a debugging flow that puts UX first\n  * Creating a culture change towards observability, getting your team invested through hands-on drills\n\n\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Martha Lambert\nProduct Engineer @incident.io, Building Reliable and Observable Systems\nMartha Lambert is a Product Engineer at incident.io.\nShe's passionate about building delightful products for engineers, where currently she's trying to make being paged feel good (somehow). Martha cares about building reliable, observable systems that don't feel scary to change, and the tradeoffs you make to get there.\nIn her spare time, she knits.\nRead more\n#####  Find Martha Lambert at: \n  * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Martha Lambert\nProduct Engineer @incident.io, Building Reliable and Observable Systems\n#### Date\nWednesday Apr 9 / 02:45PM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nWhittle (3rd Fl.)\n#### Track\nConnecting Systems: APIs, Protocols, Observability\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession resiliency\n### Timeouts, Retries and Idempotency In Distributed Systems\nWednesday Apr 9 / 10:35AM BST\nThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\u201d - this quote attributed to Einstein warns us of the danger of magical thinking, hoping that trying something just one more time will achieve success when before we failed. But is this really insanity? \nSam Newman\nMicroservice, Cloud, CI/CD Expert, Author of \"Building Microservices\" and \"Monolith to Microservices\", 20+ Years Experience as a Developer\nTimeouts, Retries and Idempotency In Distributed Systems\nSession architecture\n### Platforms for Secure API Connectivity With Architecture as Code\nWednesday Apr 9 / 03:55PM BST\nAs microservices and complex platforms become the standard, ensuring secure connectivity while maintaining a smooth developer experience is a significant challenge.
