It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nFabien Deshayes, a Platform Engineering Manager at Monzo, presents a talk on achieving optimal efficiency with Developer Experience (DevEx) teams, drawing from his experience at Monzo and Spotify.\n**Key Topics Discussed:**\n  * _Introduction to Monzo's Developer Experience Team:_ Started in December 2023 with a small team focused on building an experimentation platform to improve engineering velocity.\n  * _Improving Experimentation:_ The old platform was replaced, doubling experiments from 70 to 134 and reducing decision time from 43 to 21 days.\n  * _Assembling a DevEx Team:_ Importance of finding engineers with product acumen, tenure in the company, and good soft skills.\n  * _Impactful Products:_ Designing products that align with company values and solving real problems.\n  * _Communicating the Impact:_ Use metrics like time, money, productivity, adoption, and future enablement to measure and communicate the product's impact.\n\n\n**Challenges and Strategies:**\n  * Building a diverse DevEx team without needing \u201csuperstar\u201d engineers but focusing on skill alignment and collaboration.\n  * Understanding and utilizing product frameworks like the Core 4 and SPACE for measuring productivity.\n  * Ensuring adoption through a balance of \"carrot and stick\" strategies\u2014creating compelling products and sometimes requiring adoption.\n\n\n**Conclusion:** The talk focuses on assembling the right team, creating impactful DevEx products, and effectively communicating their impact. It emphasizes integrating into an organization's engineering culture as a key strategy for enhancing developer experience.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nDeveloper Experience teams are quite popular these days as organisations understand the value of optimising for developers productivity.\nAt Monzo, we have a Developer Experience team that aims to meaningfully increase velocity by landing exceptional developer experiences, for example we delivered a Feature Flag and Experimentation Platform across Monzo to increase experimentation by 50%.\nIn this presentation, we bring you insights and learnings from our experience, with particular focus on:\n  * Getting the right people and tools in place for a successful Developer Experience team\n  * Building impactful Developer Experiences that matter\n  * Communicating effectively about the impact of a Developer Experience team\n\n\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nI am an Engineering Manager, focusing on enabling my teams to achieve operational excellence in order to deliver delightful experiences to the rest of the engineering organisation at Monzo.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nDeveloper Experience (DexEx) is still a very new practice and I believe it is not well understood across organizations. I want to share my experience building and operating DevEx teams.\n### Who is your talk for?\nAny engineer who wants to make an impact in the DevEx space, or any engineering leader who wants to learn how to support engineers in this space.\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nI want them to be convinced that you need strong product acumen to be a great DevEx engineer.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nI see a lot of potential in platforms that enable integration between AI agents to leverage multiple models across user flows, and not limited to discrete tasks.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Fabien Deshayes\nEngineering Manager - Platform & Developer Experience @Monzo, Previously @Spotify\nFabien is a Platform Engineering Manager at Monzo, where he leads the Developer Experience team in order to meaningfully increase velocity of engineers by landing exceptional developer experiences. Prior to Monzo, Fabien worked as an Engineering Manager at Spotify where he contributed to Backstage, the open source Developer Portal; in particular Fabien looked at how organizations can scale successfully by creating platform products.\nRead more\n#####  Find Fabien Deshayes at: \n  *   * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Fabien Deshayes\nEngineering Manager - Platform & Developer Experience @Monzo, Previously @Spotify\n#### Date\nMonday Apr 7 / 01:35PM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nChurchill (Ground Fl.)\n#### Track\nEngineering Productivity and Developer Experience\n#### Topics\nPlatform Engineering developer experience Engineering Management\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession Coding\n### From Autocomplete to Agents: AI Coding State of Play\nMonday Apr 7 / 02:45PM BST\nAfter almost 2 years of intense attention givent to coding assistants, at the beginning of 2025, many organizations were disappointed by the measurable results. The recent arrival of coding assistance agents though has stirred up and reset expectations and the hype.&nbsp; \nBirgitta B\u00f6ckeler\nGlobal Lead for AI-assisted Software Delivery @Thoughtworks, Software Developer, Architect, and Technical Leader, 20 Years Experience in Technology\nFrom Autocomplete to Agents: AI Coding State of Play\nSession developer productivity\n### Productivity Is Messing Around and Having Fun\nMonday Apr 7 / 10:35AM BST\nDeveloper satisfaction, developer joy, and business results are strongly correlated. Developer productivity frameworks like SPACE recognize this, with Satisfaction being a key metric. And yet - our jobs are frustrating, filled with mindless work, and free of joy.

Platform engineering is no exception. While the term has become increasingly popular over the last few years, it is a concept that is organically evolving within industry. \nRachael Wonnacott\nAssociate Director for Container Platform Engineering @Fidelity International\nYour Platform is Not an Island: Embracing Evolution in Your Ecosystem\nSession\n### Unconference: Engineering Productivity and Developer Experience\nMonday Apr 7 / 05:05PM BST\nUnconference: Engineering Productivity and Developer Experience\n"
