Initially developed at Fly to replace Consul for service discovery, Corrosion has evolved to power the platform, enabling the rapid dissemination of machine and service data across numerous nodes with a p99 latency of one second. Leveraging technologies such as Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for conflict resolution, the SWIM gossip protocol for membership management, and the QUIC transport protocol, Corrosion is implemented in Rust and is open-source. In this talk, we will explore these technologies, dive into architectural and design decisions, and discuss how Corrosion is used in production at Fly. Whether you're familiar with these concepts or they're new to you, join us for an in-depth look at Corrosion.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Somtochi Onyekwere\nSoftware Engineer @fly.io, Previously Developer Experience Engineer @Weaveworks\nInfraOps Engineer at Fly.io.
