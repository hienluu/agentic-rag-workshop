Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled _The Form of AI_ , given by Savannah Kunovsky, explores the evolving landscape of AI technology and its integration into everyday life. Here are the key points from the presentation:\n  * Emphasis on a **human-centered approach** to AI design, ensuring that technology aligns with human needs and desires rather than merely technical possibilities.\n  * Discussion on innovative AI concepts such as wearable pants you can talk to, a camera that plays back vibes, and an Olfactory ScentCapture sphere.\n  * Highlight the importance of design thinking in the development of AI, ensuring that products are not only cutting-edge but also impactful and useful.\n  * The role of Gen Z\u2019s perspectives in shaping future AI interactions, focusing on authenticity and human connection.\n  * Presentation of research methodologies involving Gen Z to gain insights into how AI can be integrated meaningfully and ethically.\n  * Inspiration drawn from cultural media and movements to reimagine AI\u2019s role and presence in society.\n  * Examples of practical applications and design provocations that illustrate potential future AI interactions designed with creative input.\n\n\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nToday\u2019s go-to consumer AI is a chatbot, but that\u2019s just training wheels for the future. The designers, engineers, and futurists at IDEO have been imagining the forms AI will take over the coming years \u2014 and asking ourselves the hard question: how do we actually want to interact with AI? This talk will cover our human-centered approach to the next generation of AI and provocations for AI hardware people will actually be excited to use. We'll share our thoughts, from wearable pants you can talk to, to a unique camera that plays back your vibes. We\u2019ll reimagine existing devices - like the \u201cViewmaster\u201d, along with inventing brand-new devices - like an Olfactory ScentCapture sphere. Join us as we expand our minds, erasing the constraints of today and imagine the form of AI in the future.\nInterview\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nThe focus of my work is bridging the gap between emerging technologies\u2014like AI and other innovations born in research labs\u2014and real-world applications that are both useful and desirable. I do this through human-centered design, product strategy, and innovation, pushing new technologies to align with human wants and needs while leveraging their full potential. My work spans multiple industries, from global electronics and tech to social media and gaming, helping companies define what\u2019s next for their consumer products and design the next generation of interactions.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nAs AI lowers barriers to creation, enabling a greater number of technical folks to realize their ideas, it\u2019s becoming increasingly important for software engineers to be able to understand user research and design. The ability to build is powerful, but the real impact comes from combining technical capabilities with a deep understanding of human needs. The motivation for my talk comes from my own journey\u2014from software engineering to designing software and hardware\u2014and the realization that the most transformative innovations come when we bring together technical abilities and design to create meaningful, useful experiences.\n### Who is your talk for?\nMy talk is for engineers, designers, product leaders\u2014anyone interested in shaping the future of AI by exploring the forms it might take and how to create experiences people truly want to use. It\u2019s about using the act of building as a way to uncover what AI is capable of and mapping those capabilities to human needs, different value systems, and new ways of thinking. By approaching AI design with this mindset, we can move beyond legacy assumptions and shape the next generation of technology in ways that are more intentional, useful, and impactful.\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nI want attendees to walk away with the understanding that as creators and builders, we are all designers, too. There\u2019s immense power in recognizing how design intersects with technology\u2014and with that power comes responsibility. The choices we make shape how AI integrates into people\u2019s lives, and we should take that role seriously. At the same time, this next generation of technology holds incredible potential, and unlocking it requires the right orientation: a mindset that explores not just what AI can do, but what it should do to create meaningful, transformative experiences.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nThe biggest disruption in software right now is AI, particularly in how it enables new forms of assistance. But what\u2019s on the horizon\u2014and what really interests me\u2014is the evolution of the marketplaces through which we access and use technology. The iPhone\u2019s success wasn\u2019t just about the hardware; it was the App Store that unlocked its full potential, fueling a wave of innovation and the startup boom. I think we\u2019re at a similar inflection point with AI. The way we find, create, and interact with software is going to change radically, moving beyond the app model we\u2019re familiar with. The next big disruption will redefine how we access information, experiences, and tools\u2014shaping entirely new ways of getting things done.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Savannah Kunovsky\nManaging Director, Emerging Technology @IDEO, Building the Future of Technology and Design, Prev.
