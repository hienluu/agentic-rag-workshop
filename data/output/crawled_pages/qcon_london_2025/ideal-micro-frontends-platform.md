It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation \"The Ideal Micro-Frontends Platform\" discusses the challenges and strategies involved in implementing micro-frontends effectively. Here is a structured summary:\n  * **Speaker Introduction:**\nLuca Mezzalira is the principal solutions architect at AWS, who has extensive experience in software architectures, especially micro-frontends.\n  * **Background:**\nThe talk begins with the challenges faced when transforming a backend monolith into a scalable, flexible architecture for a growing company.\n  * **Core Concepts:**\n    * _Incremental and Independent Deployment:_ It's essential for successful micro-frontend strategies. Deployment should be frequent and independent.\n    * _Micro-frontends Definition:_ They are technical representations of business subdomains that allow independent implementation and minimize shared code.\n  * **Strategies for Implementation:**\n    * Adopt a JSON schema for better micro-frontend configuration and management.\n    * Leverage distributed architecture to decentralize and minimize the overhead on development teams.\n    * Consider client-side composition and routing managed usually by a platform team.\n  * **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n    * Thinking of micro-frontends as a mere technical decision rather than a business-driven approach.\n    * Overemphasizing framework diversity which can lead to complexity.\n  * **Conclusion:**\nThe presentation encourages adopting micro-frontends not just for technical benefits but for their organizational advantages, advocating for incremental upgrades and decentralization.\n\n\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nMicro-frontends can help organizations scale frontend development, but without the right foundations, they often lead to unnecessary complexity and performance issues. How can you implement them effectively while avoiding common pitfalls?\nHaving worked with hundreds of teams worldwide on micro-frontend architectures, I\u2019ve seen what works\u2014and what doesn\u2019t\u2014across different industries. In this session, I\u2019ll share real-world insights and proven strategies to help you build successful, maintainable, and scalable frontend distributed systems.\nYou\u2019ll learn:\n  * How to decide if micro-frontends are right for your organization\n  * The key architectural principles that drive successful implementations\n  * Common mistakes companies make and how to avoid them\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re considering micro-frontends or looking to refine your approach, this talk will provide actionable guidance backed by real-world experience.\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nI\u2019m a serverless specialist architect in AWS. I help customers design, build, and leverage AWS serverless services properly. In the past 4 years, I helped roughly 100 teams worldwide implementing micro-frontends using serverless but also without it.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nConsidering I have the possibility to see so many teams and organisations moving towards micro-frontends, I gathered what worked and what not, and I decided to share it in a single talk covering the most common pitfalls I\u2019ve seen in the trenches and how to overcome them.\n### Who is your talk for?\nDevelopers and tech leaders who are thinking of using micro-frontends or who have a micro-frontends implementation in production but feel there is friction within teams and in what they have implemented so far.\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nThe talk has very practical insights starting from the beginning and provides several heuristics to follow for properly designing a micro-frontends platform. Organizations need to understand that it is not just code that creates an application, but they need to look at the social-technical aspect of it.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nI\u2019m investing time working with AI for serverless and micro-frontends, focusing primarily on developer experience and understanding how AI can help developers with their tasks. Probably a common answer, but I think the proper use of AI can augment our capabilities properly. And I say augment, not replace, because I don\u2019t believe we are near the idea that you can substitute developers with AI.\n### What was one interesting thing that you learned from a previous QCon?\nThe content is super high quality, but the thing that stands out to me is the possibility to network with brilliant minds and well-known names in the industry: priceless!\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Luca Mezzalira\nPrincipal Serverless Specialist Solutions Architect @AWS, Author of \u201cBuilding Micro-Frontends\u201d, International Speaker\nLuca Mezzalira is principal solutions architect at AWS, an international speaker, and an author.
