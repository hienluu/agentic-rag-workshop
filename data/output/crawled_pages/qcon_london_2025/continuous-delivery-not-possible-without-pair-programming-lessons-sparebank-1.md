We quickly experienced something very interesting: it was nearly impossible with this high frequency of deployments without doing pair/mob programming.\nThis shift proved transformative: it enhanced development speed, focus, and flow while reducing errors. Developers also reported greater satisfaction, frequently citing improved focus and smoother workflows. The quality of delivered software significantly improved and customers got better products.\nIn this presentation, we will explain how we changed course, how we tested continuous deployment with tiny changes, and how the number of deployments increased dramatically. We will explain why deploying small changes while developing (and not after it is finished) has become crucial if you want to do modern software development.\nYou will learn about the positive consequences we experienced on reducing use of pull requests and test environments, improved pair/mob programming, quality, focus, flow, psychological safety, and more - without it being a goal in itself.\nFurthermore, we will explain how we, together with SINTEF, have done so-called \"pair programming interventions\" with teams in periods of 3-4 weeks, and successfully introduced pair/mob programming in a successful way.\n## Interview:\n### What's the focus of your work these days?\nIn our day-to-day job, we are software developers in an autonomous team of five people. We both love programming.\nSince we started working together, we have constantly been looking for better and more efficient ways of working. From the very beginning, our focus was simple: break everything down into tiny pieces, get fast feedback, reduce waste, work together on everything, and have fun doing it.\nWe quickly learned that to be able to deploy to production several times an hour, code reviews (and pull requests) had to be done as part of the development process, and not as a handover to someone else. This means pair/mob programming became 100% necessary to keep up flow, focus, and speed. Code reviews and pull requests disappeared as a natural consequence of doing modern software development. TDD became not just meaningful, but necessary. We hardly use test environments anymore; instead, we test locally, on CI, and in production.\nWe work across the organization to spread the knowledge of how we work, both through coaching and talks. We also work closely with scientists at SINTEF Digital, and we do external talks at conferences and help other companies in Norway.\n### What's the motivation for your talk at QCon London 2025?\nWe want to show people that working this way is possible, even though we work in finance and have apps that handle millions of requests per day. We want to demonstrate that it is possible to do modern software development with low stress and a resting heart rate.\n### How would you describe your main persona and target audience for this session?\nEveryone who wants to deliver better software faster, who wants to improve their focus and flow, and who wants to improve their team's psychological safety. The talk does not require a high technical level and should be valuable for everyone from developers to leaders.\n### Is there anything specific that you'd like people to walk away with after watching your session?\nThe talk explains explicit, actionable things that all teams can use immediately when they get back to their office. For example, how to start pair programming, how to increase focus, how to split a new feature into small pieces, and deploy to production several times a day.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nWe do not think we have seen the peak of GenAI, but we do not think it will replace us entirely. Finding ways of working with GenAI without compromising the quality of the code will be crucial. We think that the core methods of software development, like building systems that are easy to maintain and change, will be even more important in the future.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Asgaut Mj\u00f8lne S\u00f6derbom\nSenior Software Developer @SpareBank 1 Utvikling, Previously Worked @Bouvet, @FINN, and @TietoEVRY, 19+ Years in Software Development\nAsgaut Mj\u00f8lne S\u00f6derbom is a senior developer at SpareBank 1 Utvikling, Oslo. He has a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.  \n  \nAsgaut has worked as a developer since 2006. He has previously worked in-house at FINN and TietoEVRY, but also worked several years as a consultant - both independently and at Bouvet.
