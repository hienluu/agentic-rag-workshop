In the span of three years, my organization grew from 30 engineers to over 100, forcing me to recalibrate everything from meeting structures to team compositions to decision-making frameworks to scale myself.\nI remember feeling like I was changing the wheels on a speeding train\u2014trying to keep velocity while fundamentally reworking how we operated.\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll share the highs, lows, and practical lessons from each year of this journey. We\u2019ll explore the patterns that emerged as I navigated the organizational change: experimenting to find the right team topologies, building the leadership team, and embracing reorganizations as a natural part of scaling.\n### Key Takeaways:\n  * **Up-leveling for Resilience & Sustainability** \u2013 How to raise seniority, rotate expertise, and optimize team sizing and tenure distribution to enhance knowledge transfer, reduce silos, and build resilient squads that excel in crisis management, sustain operations, and tackle complex technical challenges.\n  * **Building an Empowered & Coherent Leadership Team** \u2013 Approaches for spotting and nurturing leaders who can carry the vision & the strategy through multiple layers of the organization.\n  * **Continuous Reorganizations as a Feature, Not a Bug** \u2013 How to view reorgs as iterative improvements rather than chaotic disruptions, and the communication strategies that make them stick.\n\n\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Thiago Ghisi\nDirector of Engineering @Nubank & Co-Host of @EngAdvicePod, Previously @Apple & @ThoughtWorks\nThiago Ghisi is the Director of Engineering for the Mobile Platform team at Nubank.
