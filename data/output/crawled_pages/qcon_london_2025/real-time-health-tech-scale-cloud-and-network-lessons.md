In this talk, we\u2019ll walk through the design and delivery of a health tech platform that meets these challenges head-on.\nWe\u2019ll explore:\n  * Real-world networking constraints in clinical and remote settings \u2014 and how to design around them\n  * A high-level cloud architecture that balances scalability, security, and compliance for med tech applications\n  * Strategies for delivering consistent software environments across varied regions and infrastructures  \n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll also touch on real-time video processing in healthcare settings \u2014 from low-latency pipelines to edge-to-cloud orchestration \u2014 and share lessons learned building systems that need to be both fast and reliable under pressure.\n* * *\n#### Share\nShare Share\n"
