Here is a structured summary:\n**Introduction**\n  * Presenter: Lesley Cordero, Staff Software Engineer at The New York Times, focusing on reliability platforms.\n  * Objective: To discuss platform engineering as a methodology for organizational and sociotechnical change.\n  * Foundational Concepts: Explanation of socio-technical systems and their relevance to technology organizations.\n\n\n**Key Concepts**\n  * _Socio-Technical Systems_ : Emphasizes the intertwined nature of social and technical aspects in organizations.\n  * _Joint Optimization_ : Integration of social and technical systems must be improved together.\n  * _Leadership and Tension_ : Leadership involves managing tensions between technical and social components, requiring intentional balance and adaptability.\n\n\n**Platform Engineering Fundamentals**\n  * Positioned at the intersection of _infrastructure, developer experience,_ and _product delivery_.\n  * Promotes creating internal platforms that enhance _automation, reliability,_ and _feedback-driven iteration_.\n  * Encourages reducing cognitive load and enabling efficient and safe deployments through platform decisions.\n\n\n**Principles and Practices**\n  * Importance of _design-driven architecture_ and using modularity and abstraction.\n  * Advises on addressing user-developer experience tensions by prioritizing end-user needs without compromising system reliability.\n  * Stresses the role of communal learning for sustainable advantage and advocating for a community-informed leadership style.\n\n\n**Challenges and Solutions**\n  * Addresses challenges in maintaining balance between _standardization versus flexibility_ and _simplicity versus complexity_.\n  * Recommends using shared community knowledge to prevent silos and enhance quality.\n  * Promotes using external solutions for better efficiency and reduced maintenance burdens.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n  * Platform engineering is highlighted as a socio-technical strategy for overcoming organizational complexities and enhancing scalability and sustainability.\n  * Insights offered into evolving architectural strategies to address growing technical and organizational needs.\n\n\nThe presentation provides a comprehensive guide for leveraging platform engineering to integrate socio-technical systems effectively, emphasizing leadership, strategic design, and the balance of tensions in complex organizations.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore DevOps as a foundational model for technical leadership that directly supports organizational sustainability. We'll focus on how platform engineering teams are uniquely positioned to lead by example through the intentional application of DevOps principles and platform practices.\nPlatform Engineering sits at the intersection of infrastructure, developer experience, and product delivery. By designing internal platforms that prioritize automation, reliability, and developer feedback, platform engineers can shape how technical excellence scales across an organization. This talk will dig into how to embed DevOps principles -- like strong ownership models, feedback-driven iteration, and psychologically safe deployment processes -- into platform tooling and workflows. We\u2019ll cover strategies for reducing cognitive load, enabling fast and safe deploys, and driving cross-team alignment through platform decisions.\nKey Takeaways:\n  * How platform teams can operationalize DevOps by codifying reliability, security, and velocity into shared infrastructure and tooling\n  * How to use platform abstractions to align developer experience with business priorities\n  * Why platform engineering is essential to scaling both systems and culture, and how that supports long-term organizational resilience\n  * How to design and maintain technical boundaries that encourage cross-functional collaboration and reduce organizational silos.\n\n\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Lesley Cordero\nStaff Software Engineer, Tech Lead @nytimes, Focused on Observability, Shared Platforms, and Building Excellent Teams, Previously Engineer for EdTech\nLesley Cordero is currently a Staff Software Engineer, Tech Lead at The New York Times. She has spent the majority of her career on edtech teams as an engineer, including Google for Education and other edtech startups.\nIn her current role, she is focused on observability, shared platforms, and building excellent teams by setting reliability vision & strategy across The Times, improving our observability footprint, and cultivating culture that builds with the most vulnerable employees in mind first. She shows care for others by holding them accountable to the best versions of themselves \u2013 and by buying them the occasional bubble tea.\nRead more\n#### Speaker\n##### Lesley Cordero\nStaff Software Engineer, Tech Lead @nytimes, Focused on Observability, Shared Platforms, and Building Excellent Teams, Previously Engineer for EdTech\n#### Date\nTuesday Apr 8 / 10:35AM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nChurchill (Ground Fl.)\n#### Track\nBuilding a Culture that Works\n#### Topics\nPlatform Engineering technical leadership architecture Observability Reliability\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession\n### Panel: Building a Culture that Works\nTuesday Apr 8 / 05:05PM BST\nIt\u2019s Everyone\u2019s Responsibility To Build a Great Culture\u2014How Do You Do It? \nPanel: Building a Culture that Works\nSession building culture\n### Creating Impactful Teams Across Diverse Work Environments\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST\nCulture is the backbone of any thriving organization.
