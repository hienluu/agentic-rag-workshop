It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled _A Thirteen Billion Year Old Photograph_ provides an insightful look into the utilization of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to capture ancient cosmic events. The speaker, Dr. Kenneth Harris, highlights several key aspects:\n**Historical Background:** The presentation begins with the historical discovery of infrared light by Sir William Herschel, elucidating its significance in viewing the universe beyond visible wavelengths.\n**Technological Innovation:** The JWST is equipped with advanced technology to decode cosmic history, revealing intricate details of celestial bodies. It uses hardware such as a segmented mirror and cryogenic cooling systems, along with precision algorithms for data processing.\n  * _Infrared Light:_ Infrared wavelengths are crucial for observing the universe's oldest galaxies and stars, as they penetrate through cosmic dust and represent longer wavelengths associated with older stellar formations.\n  * _Image Processing:_ The process involves image stacking, calibration, and filtering to produce vivid cosmic photographs. The telescope uses various filters to assign colors based on wavelength data.\n\n\n**Scientific and Educational Impact:** The JWST provides profound educational insights and facilitates exploration into the vast expanse of the universe, challenging our understanding and encouraging further inquiry into cosmic phenomena.\nThis structured approach not only enhances our comprehension of the cosmos but also inspires renewed curiosity and pursuit of knowledge in the field of astronomy.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nOver thirteen billion years of cosmic history lie etched in the light that travels across the universe. Join Dr. Kenneth Harris, former rocket scientist and integration engineer to learn about the next generation technology developed for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as humanity's most advanced tool for decoding this ancient story\u2014revealing planets, star systems, and the violent birth and death of celestial bodies in unprecedented detail. But how does it accomplish such a feat?\nIn this keynote, we\u2019ll dive into the intersection of cutting-edge hardware and software innovations that power JWST. From its revolutionary segmented mirror and cryogenic cooling systems to the precision algorithms that process terabytes of data into vivid images of the cosmos. Participants will gain insights into how billions of years worth of data translate to breathtaking images that expand for light years, peaking human curiosity and challenging us all to explore beyond our world.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Dr. Kenneth Harris\nSenior Project Manager @The Aerospace Corporation, Former Rocket Scientist and Integration Engineer @NASA\nAcknowledged by Forbes Magazine amongst the world\u2019s youngest and most impactful individuals in the field of science, Kenneth F. Harris II is known for delivering thoughtful and dynamic leadership on programs of critical national and international importance.\nKenneth is a Senior Project Engineer for The Aerospace Corporation contributing to both DoD and NASA payload missions. In this role, Dr. Harris is responsible for developing procedures and implementing processes to defend on orbit satellites from physical and cyber threats.\nPrior to this role, Dr. Harris served as the Deputy Lead Integration Engineer for the James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s (JWST) Integrated Science Instrument Module Electronic Components (ICE). Dr. Harris led a team to successfully integrate, the main electronic payload of JWST, to the Backplane of the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) Primary Mirror. This was performed in North Americas largest cleanroom, the Space Systems Development and Integration Facility (SSDIF). Dr. Harris\u2019 leadership on the JWST program ranks him as one of the youngest African Americans in NASA\u2019s history to lead an integration effort on a multi-billion dollar satellite mission.\nSince joining NASA in 2008 as an intern, Dr. Harris has held positions of increasing responsibility including; Rocket Scientist, Senior Mechanical Engineer, and Integration & Testing Lab Manager. Dr. Harris\u2019 honors and awards extend beyond his professional service to recognition of his tremendous leadership in the STEM field and international community. He currently serves as the Vice Chair and District 7 Member of the Board of Education in his hometown of Prince George\u2019s County Maryland. Through which he champions the importance of early STEM exposure and engagement. In 2018 Dr. Harris delivered a TEDx Talk. He was internationally recognized in the Project Management Institute Future 50 in 2020 for his incredible leadership at NASA on the local and international level. In 2023, Kenneth helped initiate the \u201cPMI Chapter Student Clubs\u201d program, fostering connections between industry professionals and local universities worldwide to cultivate the next generation of Project Managers, particularly from underrepresented groups. This initiative has impacted over 1600 students across Singapore, Kenya, Mumbai, Melbourne, and parts of North America. Dr. Harris also served as a Science Show Host and correspondent for Seeker, PBS Nova and The Smithsonian.\nDr. Harris graduated with honors from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering; he then completed a Master\u2019s degree at Johns Hopkins University in Engineering Management and a Doctor of Engineering degree at George Washington University.\nA lifelong Maryland resident Dr. Harris, his wife, and two children reside in Maryland. When not leading space programs or impacting scholars, Dr. Harris enjoys fine cuisine, traveling internationally, and reading Science-Fiction.\nRead more\n#####  Find Dr. Kenneth Harris at: \n  *   * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Dr. Kenneth Harris\nSenior Project Manager @The Aerospace Corporation, Former Rocket Scientist and Integration Engineer @NASA\n#### Date\nMonday Apr 7 / 09:00AM BST ( 1 hours )\n#### Location\nFleming + Whittle (3rd Fl.)\n#### Slides\nSlides are not available\n#### Share\nShare Share\n"
