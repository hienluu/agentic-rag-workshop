It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \n**Title:** WASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\n**Speaker:** Laurent Doguin, Director of Developer Relations & Strategy at Couchbase\n**Introduction:**\nThe presentation explores the role of WebAssembly (WASM) components in enhancing Function as a Service (FaaS) platforms. It outlines the complexities involved in creating scalable, secure, and flexible FaaS architectures and how WASM offers a robust alternative to traditional containerization methods.\n  * **What is FaaS?**\nFaaS involves running application functions as needed on a serverless runtime, which abstracts away server management.\n  * **WASM Benefits:**\n    * WASM components are portable and lightweight, supporting a wide range of languages, and offer good security and isolation.\n    * They enhance observability with full support for OpenTelemetry.\n  * **Function and Serverless Architecture Differences:**\nFaaS is a subset of serverless computing, focusing on executing small, discrete pieces of code within a larger system.\n  * **Practical Example:**\nLaurent shared a use case involving CNCF's wasmCloud and Couchbase, highlighting how WASM-based solutions can be implemented in real-world applications.\n  * **NATS Messaging System:**\nDescribed as a critical component for inter-component communication, NATS facilitates message-passing across distributed systems in the WASM architecture.\n  * **Challenges in Integration:**\n    * Memory management and data exchange between WASM modules can be complex, but the new WebAssembly Component Model simplifies this by standardizing interfaces.\n    * WASM allows for extensive capability configurations, enhancing multi-cloud and multi-platform deployments.\n\n\nThe session concludes with an optimistic outlook on WASM\u2019s potential to reshape serverless architecture, enabling broader adoption and flexibility in function deployment.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nWhy would you build your own Function as a Service platform and what does a FaaS architecture look like? Building something that can scale to zero, work with your existing systems, stay secure, and handle different workloads isn\u2019t easy. You need a runtime that\u2019s flexible, supports multiple languages, and provides good isolation.\nWhen the industry first tackled this, containers seemed like the obvious answer. Maybe containers were the reason why developers started working on FaaS in the first place. But what if there was a better tool for the job? Enter WebAssembly.\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll take a look at some challenges of building FaaS platforms, the typical existing architectural, and why more teams\u2014like those at Cloudflare, Fastly, and even American Express\u2014are betting on WebAssembly.\nWe'll wrap things up with a practical example using CNCF's wasmCloud and Couchbase, and show what this new approach can look like in the real world.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Laurent Doguin\nDirector Developer Relations & Strategy @couchbase, Previously Developer Advocate @Clever Cloud and @Nuxeo\nLaurent is a nerdy metal head who lives in Paris.

What stack would you use? Would you take a bet on a programming language you've never used professionally before? When building a company from scratch, these aren\u2019t just theoretical questions \u2013 they\u2019re make-or-break decisions with real consequences. \nSam Cox\nCo-Founder & CTO @Tracebit, Building Security Canaries at Scale\nQuestioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\nSession services\n### Expanding Swift from Apps to Services\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST\nThe Swift programming language is a popular choice for applications, but many engineers are less familiar with Swift\u2019s capabilities for writing services. This session will explore why Swift is a great fit for services development, from memory safety to interoperability with other languages. \nCory Benfield\nSenior Software Engineer Doing Swift on Server @Apple\nExpanding Swift from Apps to Services\nSession WASM\n### WASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nTuesday Apr 8 / 01:35PM BST\nWebAssembly (WASM) is emerging as a powerful tool beyond its browser origins, enabling safer, more flexible, and more efficient execution across a wide range of enterprise applications.In this session, we\u2019ll take a hands-on look at real-world use cases, including: \nAndrea Peruffo\nOpen Source Addicted Software Developer @RedHat, Passionate About Distributed Systems, Compilers, Infrastructure and Everything In Between\nWASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nSession WebAssembly\n### How WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nTuesday Apr 8 / 02:45PM BST\nApplication extensions are an essential part of any software ecosystem. While Rust is a great language, its lack of a standard ABI means that the whole source code has to be available to the compiler. \nAlex Radovici\nOperating Systems & Compilers PhD, Author of \"Getting Started with Secure Embedded Systems\" and Core Contributor of Tock OS\nHow WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nSession\n### Unconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST\nUnconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\n"
