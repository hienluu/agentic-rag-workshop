It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled _WASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business_ was delivered by Andrea Peruffo, who is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, focused on open-source development, distributed systems, and compilers.\nThe talk covered several key topics related to WebAssembly (WASM) including:\n  * **Introduction to WASM:** Positioned as a portable binary execution format, initially used in browsers to execute complex tasks more efficiently than JavaScript.\n  * **Potential of WASM beyond Browsers:** Discussed its applicability in server-side environments for creating polyglot interfaces and plugin systems due to its ease of embedment into host programming languages.\n  * **Technical Advantages:** Highlighted WASM\u2019s secure sandbox environment, ensuring controlled code execution and its permanent status as a web standard.\n  * **Use Cases:** Detailed practical use cases such as JRuby for running on JVM with WASM, TrinoDB for efficient UDF execution, and Debezium for message transformation.\n\n\nIn addition, the session provided insights into overcoming challenges with WASM integration, particularly focusing on implementing WASM in Java environments using the Chicory runtime, emphasizing techniques to ensure optimal execution speed and efficiency. The presentation aimed at not only showcasing WASM's capabilities but also providing practical strategies to handle initial integration challenges, making it a valuable tool for enterprise-level applications.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nWebAssembly (WASM) is emerging as a powerful tool beyond its browser origins, enabling safer, more flexible, and more efficient execution across a wide range of enterprise applications.\nIn this session, we\u2019ll take a hands-on look at real-world use cases, including:\n  * When and why you might need WASM to bootstrap an ecosystem purely on the JVM -- JRuby\n  * How to make slow-starting interpreters practical for fast UDFs in databases by reducing startup overhead -- TrinoDB\n  * Running WASM sandboxes on the hot path while minimizing serialization overhead through lazy access to host memory -- Debezium\n\n\nWe\u2019ll explore the challenges we faced integrating WASM into existing platforms, how we overcame them, and what this means for Java and modern enterprise architectures.\nAttendees will leave with a clearer understanding of WASM's growing role in the enterprise world and a set of practical techniques to overcome initial hiccups and doubts and start using the technology in their projects.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Andrea Peruffo\nOpen Source Addicted Software Developer @RedHat, Passionate About Distributed Systems, Compilers, Infrastructure and Everything In Between\nWith nearly two decades of coding experience, I'm fueled by passion as I continue to type away daily.\nAs a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, I actively contribute to diverse Open Source projects, driven by both personal fulfillment and professional advancement.  \nMy not-so-secret passion lies in programming languages, developer tools, compilers, and beyond.

What stack would you use? Would you take a bet on a programming language you've never used professionally before? When building a company from scratch, these aren\u2019t just theoretical questions \u2013 they\u2019re make-or-break decisions with real consequences. \nSam Cox\nCo-Founder & CTO @Tracebit, Building Security Canaries at Scale\nQuestioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\nSession services\n### Expanding Swift from Apps to Services\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST\nThe Swift programming language is a popular choice for applications, but many engineers are less familiar with Swift\u2019s capabilities for writing services. This session will explore why Swift is a great fit for services development, from memory safety to interoperability with other languages. \nCory Benfield\nSenior Software Engineer Doing Swift on Server @Apple\nExpanding Swift from Apps to Services\nSession WebAssembly\n### How WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nTuesday Apr 8 / 02:45PM BST\nApplication extensions are an essential part of any software ecosystem. While Rust is a great language, its lack of a standard ABI means that the whole source code has to be available to the compiler. \nAlex Radovici\nOperating Systems & Compilers PhD, Author of \"Getting Started with Secure Embedded Systems\" and Core Contributor of Tock OS\nHow WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nSession\n### WASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nTuesday Apr 8 / 05:05PM BST\nWhy would you build your own Function as a Service platform and what does a FaaS architecture look like? Building something that can scale to zero, work with your existing systems, stay secure, and handle different workloads isn\u2019t easy. \nLaurent Doguin\nDirector Developer Relations & Strategy @couchbase, Previously Developer Advocate @Clever Cloud and @Nuxeo\nWASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nSession\n### Unconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST\nUnconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\n"
