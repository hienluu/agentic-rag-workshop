Cultural alignment refers to ensuring that new hires share the same beliefs, values, and practices as the existing team, which enhances teamwork and productivity.\n**Main Points Discussed:**\n  * **Understanding Culture:** Culture in a workplace comprises shared values, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and practices.\n  * **Importance of Cultural Alignment:** Culturally aligned teams tend to work faster, enjoy higher job satisfaction, and have fewer conflicts.\n  * **Hiring Strategies:**\n    * Balancing technical assessments with cultural evaluation is crucial.\n    * Interviews should focus not only on technical skills but also on cultural signals.\n  * **Assessment Techniques:** Setting clear criteria for cultural attributes during interviews and debriefs helps in integrating cultural evaluation into the hiring process.\n  * **Dynamic Nature of Culture:** Culture evolves with the company; hence, it is essential to continuously revisit and align cultural attributes as the organization grows.\n\n\nThis presentation underscores that cultural alignment is a key element for company growth, ensuring teams work harmoniously and efficiently together.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nTechnical interviews typically focus on coding skills, but cultural alignment is equally crucial for team success. This talk explores how to assess cultural fit during the hiring process, examining specific attributes that matter in engineering teams and techniques for creating interviews where candidates can authentically demonstrate their working style. Attendees will learn strategies for balancing technical assessment with cultural evaluation while avoiding vague notions of \"culture.\"\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Alicia Collymore\nSenior Engineering Manager @Incident.io, Dedicated to Leading Teams That Deliver Impactful Software\nAlicia has been an engineering manager for over five years, with a dynamic career spanning multiple industries.
