It highlights the complexities and adjustments required as businesses strive to integrate multi-cloud strategies, containerization, and modern networking infrastructure.\n**Key Points Discussed:**\n  * _Network Functionality and Evolution_ : Networks are often too primitive, focusing more on moving data at high speeds rather than offering useful features for applications.\n  * _Application vs. Network Prioritization_ : There's a call to make networks more beneficial to applications rather than merely serving the needs of network administrators.\n  * _Networking Identity_ : Emphasizes the significance of introducing verifiable identities in networking to enhance security and simplify policy management.\n  * _Policy Composability_ : Highlights the need for composable policies to ensure networks and their components can integrate seamlessly and remain flexible.\n  * _Proxy and Policy Patterns_ : Discusses common network management patterns such as using large proxies and centralized policy stores, their benefits, and potential drawbacks.\n  * _Infrastructure Repeatability_ : Stresses the importance of developing networks that provide consistent controls across diverse infrastructure setups, aided by commodity infrastructure like open-source tools.\n\n\nThis presentation combines technical insights with philosophical perspectives, urging a shift in how networking is approached in enterprise environments to better support application development and business objectives.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nDelivering a 'useful' network in the typical enterprise has always been challenging. Whether it's the rush to containerization, business goals around accelerated value delivery or regulatory pressure to be multi-cloud or even resurrect your own data centers, that job keeps getting harder. How should we evaluate the tools we use and how do we want them to compose to be useful?\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Louis Ryan\nCTO @solo.io, Co-Creator of Istio and gRPC\n_Husband, dad, bad fisherman & Irish rugby fan _\nRead more\n#####  Find Louis Ryan at: \n  *   *   * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Louis Ryan\nCTO @solo.io, Co-Creator of Istio and gRPC\n#### Date\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nWhittle (3rd Fl.)\n#### Track\nMulti-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Architectures\n#### Topics\nnetworking servicemesh APIs\n#### Slides\nSlides are not available\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession architecture\n### Building Distributed Event-Driven Architectures Across Multi-Cloud Boundaries\nTuesday Apr 8 / 10:35AM BST\n\u201cEvent-driven architecture\u201d is a frequently discussed topic in architectural conversations.
