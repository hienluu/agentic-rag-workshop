The old norms are being overturned in front of us. What used to be expensive is now cheap, what was slow is now fast, what used to be a sensible default is now a massive mistake.\nThis track will take the practice of architecture out of its echo chamber. The speakers will share their experiences, wisdom, and insights straight from this new world. There will be multiple perspectives and no guarantees. No-one will tell you to copy what they did, but you will learn about how they thought, what they did, how they thought about that thinking, and most importantly what they learned.\nJoin us to have your mind opened, and the joy returned to the practice of software architecture.\n* * *\n### From this track\nSession architecture\n### Holistic Engineering: Organic Problem Solving for Complex Evolving Systems\nWednesday Apr 9 / 10:35AM BST\nEvery day developers have to work with code influenced by past decisions made by non-technical departments. Every day there are defects and other obstacles caused by non-technical factors that are nonetheless reflected in your code. \nVanessa Formicola\nPrincipal Engineer @FloHealth, Ex Thoughtworks & Microsoft, Community Builder and Social Change Advocate\nHolistic Engineering: Organic Problem Solving for Complex Evolving Systems\nSession architecture\n### The Friction Fix: Building Collaborative Relationships Between Teams\nWednesday Apr 9 / 11:45AM BST\nIn today's fast-paced and interconnected world, the friction between product and technology teams often feels inevitable. \nCat Morris\nStaff Product Manager @Syntasso, Previously Platform and Enterprise Modernization Specialist @ThoughtWorks\nDiana Montalion\nFounder @Mentrix Group, Systems Architect, and Author of \"Learning Systems Thinking\"\nThe Friction Fix: Building Collaborative Relationships Between Teams\nSession architecture\n### Security and Architecture: To Betray One Is To Destroy Both\nWednesday Apr 9 / 01:35PM BST\nFlawed architecture introduces vulnerabilities that even the best security cannot mitigate. Likewise, a well-architected system without robust security remains a ticking time bomb in the face of modern threats. \nShana Dacres-Lawrence\nSenior Principal Architect @6point6 | Part of Accenture, Founder for ArchitectHer\nSecurity and Architecture: To Betray One Is To Destroy Both\nSession architecture\n### Empowering Teams: Decentralizing Architectural Decision-Making\nWednesday Apr 9 / 02:45PM BST\nIn today\u2019s rapidly evolving tech landscape, centralised architectural decision-making can become a bottleneck to delivery performance and innovation. \nPeter Hunter\nHead of R&D, Tech Architect @OpenGI, Led the Transformation of a Legacy Solution Into a Modern Cloud-Based SaaS Platform\nElena Stojmilova\nTechnical Lead @Open GI\nEmpowering Teams: Decentralizing Architectural Decision-Making\nSession\n### Panel: Taking Architecture Out of the Echo Chamber\nWednesday Apr 9 / 03:55PM BST\nArchitecture is increasingly about ensuring that the right conversations are happening at the right time and involving the right people in the right ways. \nPanel: Taking Architecture Out of the Echo Chamber\n#### Track Host\n##### Andrew Harmel-Law\nTechnical Principal @Thoughtworks, Author of Facilitating Software Architecture, Trainer for O'Reilly, Consultant, and DDD (Over) Enthusiast \n#### Date\nWednesday Apr 9 / 10:35AM BST \n#### Share\nShare Share\n### Track Host\n#### Andrew Harmel-Law\nTechnical Principal @Thoughtworks, Author of Facilitating Software Architecture, Trainer for O'Reilly, Consultant, and DDD (Over) Enthusiast \nAndrew is a Tech Principal at Thoughtworks, specializing in Java / JVM technologies, agile delivery, build tools and automation, and domain driven design. They have experience across the software development lifecycle and in many sectors.\nAndrew is also an author and trainer for O\u2019Reilly. They've written one book about facilitating software architecture and one chapter about implementing the Accelerate/DORA four key metrics. They also run regular online training sessions in Domain-Drive Design (First Steps) and Architecture Decision Making by Example.\nWhat motivates Andrew is the humane delivery and sustainable evolution of large-scale software solutions, that fulfill complex user needs. They understand that people, architecture, process and tooling all have key roles to play in achieving this.\nAndrew has a great passion for open source software and its communities. They have been involved with OSS to a greater or lesser extent since their career began; as a user, contributor, expert group member, or paid advocate - most notably as one of the Jenkins JobDSL originators.\nAndrew enjoys sharing their experience as much as possible. This sharing is not only seen in their formal consulting engagements, but also informally through mentoring, blog posts, conferences (speaking and organising), and open-sourcing their code.\nRead more\n#####  Find Andrew Harmel-Law at: \n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n"
