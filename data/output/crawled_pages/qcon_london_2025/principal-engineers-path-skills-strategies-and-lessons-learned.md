But careers aren\u2019t like ladders\u2014short, straight, and evenly spaced. Instead, they\u2019re long, winding, and often challenging journeys.\nPrincipal Engineers provide engineering leadership, and that isn\u2019t just about deep technical expertise. It also demands broader and hard-to-master skills\u2014like influence, communication, and strategic thinking.\nWith 30 years in tech, Sophie will reflect on her career and share key insights on what helped her navigate the path from Junior Developer to Principal Engineer. This talk will explore the skills, strategies, and support that can help you shape and sustain your own career growth\u2014whether you're aiming for Principal Engineer or another leadership role.\n### Key takeaways:\n  * Your career is a path, not a ladder\u2014the journey matters as much as the destination, if not more.\n  * A growth mindset and intrinsic motivation are key\u2014you need to grow for yourself, not just to reach a goal.\n  * Organizations and managers should provide growth opportunities, but it\u2019s up to you to seize them.  \n\n\n\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Sophie Weston\nPrincipal Engineer @ClearBank, Co-Organizer of DevOpsDays London & FastFlowConf\nSophie has spent nearly thirty years working in technology as a software engineer and DevOps advocate.
