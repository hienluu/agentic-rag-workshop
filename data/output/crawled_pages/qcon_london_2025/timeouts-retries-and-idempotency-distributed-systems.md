It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled \"Timeouts, Retries, and Idempotency in Distributed Systems\" by Sam Newman provides insights into handling these fundamental concepts effectively to improve the resilience of distributed systems.\n**Introduction**\nSam Newman, a technologist with expertise in cloud, microservices, and continuous delivery, explores the basics of distributed systems crucial for developers. The talk addresses timeouts, retries, and idempotency as core concepts.\n**Golden Rules of Distributed Systems**\n  * You cannot instantly beam information between two points.\n  * You may not always be able to reach the desired service.\n  * Resources are not infinite.\n\n\n**Timeouts**\n  * Timeouts are used to terminate requests after a certain threshold to manage resources effectively.\n  * Setting appropriate timeout durations is crucial to prevent resource overconsumption or premature termination.\n\n\n**Retries**\n  * Retries are essential for handling transient failures in distributed systems.\n  * Randomizing retry intervals (jitter) helps prevent synchronized retries that can lead to system overloads.\n  * Managing retry logic ensures that retries do not compound issues.\n\n\n**Idempotency**\n  * Idempotency ensures that multiple identical requests result in the same outcome, preventing erroneous repeated operations.\n  * Using unique request IDs is recommended to track and manage operations without altering final results.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe talk emphasizes understanding and implementing these concepts from the start to establish resilient distributed systems. Sam Newman encourages developers to consider the presented strategies to enhance system reliability.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\u201d - this quote attributed to Einstein warns us of the danger of magical thinking, hoping that trying something just one more time will achieve success when before we failed. But is this really insanity?\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll argue that retrying things actually does make a lot of sense, and is in fact key to improving the resilience of a distributed system. Along the way, I\u2019ll explain the importance of timeouts, retry limits and knowing when giving up does make sense. I\u2019ll also show how retries can be made safe (and help avoid draining your bank account), and perhaps we\u2019ll get to examine that Einstein quote in a bit more detail.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Sam Newman\nMicroservice, Cloud, CI/CD Expert, Author of \"Building Microservices\" and \"Monolith to Microservices\", 20+ Years Experience as a Developer\nSam is a technologist focusing in the areas of cloud, microservices, and continuous delivery - three topics which seem to overlap frequently.

Traditional security models often introduce friction, slowing down innovation and deployment. \nJim Gough\nDistinguished Engineer, API Platform Lead Architect @Morgan Stanley, Co-Author of Optimizing Java\nPlatforms for Secure API Connectivity With Architecture as Code\nSession\n### From Dashboard Soup to Observability Lasagna: Building Better Layers\nWednesday Apr 9 / 02:45PM BST\nLet's be honest - observability can suck. Ever feel like you're swimming in dashboard soup? You know the feeling: tons of single-use dashboards, building new ones during every incident only to lose them in the chaos, and spending ages creating visualizations that no one ever looks at again. \nMartha Lambert\nProduct Engineer @incident.io, Building Reliable and Observable Systems\nFrom Dashboard Soup to Observability Lasagna: Building Better Layers\nSession APIs\n### Scaling API Independence: Mocking, Contract Testing & Observability in Large Microservices Environments\nWednesday Apr 9 / 01:35PM BST\nMicroservices promise faster deployments and team autonomy. In reality, engineers are often blocked waiting for APIs, dealing with broken sandboxes, or wrangling test environments. \nTom Akehurst\nCTO and Co-Founder @WireMock, 20+ Years Building Enterprise Systems\nScaling API Independence: Mocking, Contract Testing & Observability in Large Microservices Environments\nSession architecture\n### From Confusion to Clarity: Advanced Observability Strategies for Media Workflows at Netflix\nWednesday Apr 9 / 11:45AM BST\nManaging media workflows at the Netflix scale is both thrilling and daunting. With millions of workflow executions across hundreds of types and over 500 million CPU hours consumed quarterly, costs can skyrocket, and encoding issues can disrupt the streaming experience. \nSujana Sooreddy\nSoftware Engineer @Netflix - Building High Scale Observability Solutions\nNaveen Mareddy\nStaff Engineer @Netflix, 20+ years in Software Engineering, Creator of MediaInfra Meetup, Speaker, Mentor\nFrom Confusion to Clarity: Advanced Observability Strategies for Media Workflows at Netflix\n"
