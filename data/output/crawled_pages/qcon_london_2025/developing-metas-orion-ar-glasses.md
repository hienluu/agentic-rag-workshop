These glasses present an augmented reality experience by overlaying virtual elements onto the real world through transparent lenses.\n**Key Topics Discussed:**\n  * **Terminology:**\n    * _Virtual Reality (VR):_ Full immersion in a digital environment.\n    * _Mixed Reality (MR):_ Blends real world and digital content.\n    * _Augmented Reality (AR):_ Overlays virtual objects onto the real environment.\n  * **Product Features:**\n    * Lightweight glasses with a wide field of view.\n    * Uses micro LED projectors located in the temples with custom waveguide technology.\n    * Multiple cameras and sensors for eye tracking, EMG (Electromyography), and spatial audio.\n    * Incorporates hand tracking and voice commands for user input.\n  * **Technical Innovations:**\n    * World-lock rendering to integrate virtual objects seamlessly with the real world.\n    * High precision control of photon path to user\u2019s eyes using silicon carbide lenses.\n    * A system of 11 microcontroller units for distributed computing and heat management.\n  * **Design Challenges:**\n    * Maintaining device lightweight and thermally efficient.\n    * Balancing performance with battery life.\n    * Developing new APIs for innovative user interaction.\n\n\nThe presentation emphasizes lessons learned from the project, such as selective ambition in technology development and the importance of testing in managing complexity.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nMeta announced the Orion AR Glasses in September 2024. It is a time machine to demonstrate that it's possible to build an immersive augmented reality experience in a glasses form-factor. There were numerous technical challenges to make this a reality. This talk will focus on the technical innovations that went into Orion, and lessons learned for building such an ambitious product.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Jinsong Yu\nSoftware Engineer @Meta, Led the Development of Orion AR Glasses Software Stack, Previously @Google and @Microsoft\nJinsong Yu is a seasoned software engineer who had led the development of multiple products in Meta, Google, Microsoft, etc. Most recently in Meta, he led the software development work of the Smart Glasses (Ray-Ban Meta) and AR Glasses (Orion) project.\nRead more\n#####  Find Jinsong Yu at: \n  * \n\n#### Speaker\n##### Jinsong Yu\nSoftware Engineer @Meta, Led the Development of Orion AR Glasses Software Stack, Previously @Google and @Microsoft\n#### Date\nMonday Apr 7 / 11:45AM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nWhittle (3rd Fl.)\n#### Track\nArchitectures You've Always Wondered About\n#### Topics\naugmented reality electromyography HW/SW Co-Engineering\n#### Slides\nSlides are not available\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession AI/ML\n### Lessons Learned From Building LinkedIn\u2019s First Agent: Hiring Assistant\nMonday Apr 7 / 05:05PM BST\nIn October 2024, we announced LinkedIn\u2019s first agent, Hiring Assistant to a select group of LinkedIn customers. \nKarthik Ramgopal\nDistinguished Engineer & Tech Lead of the Product Engineering Team @LinkedIn, 15+ Years of Experience in Full-Stack Software Development \nDaniel Hewlett\nPrincipal AI Engineer & Technical Lead for AI @LinkedIn, 12+ Years of Expierence in ML and AI Engineering, Previously @Google\nLessons Learned From Building LinkedIn\u2019s First Agent: Hiring Assistant\nSession architecture\n### Architecture in the Lead: Scaling Today, Shaping Tomorrow\nMonday Apr 7 / 10:35AM BST\nThe BBC\u2019s websites and apps handled well over 100 million visitors in 2024, with 40 million people arriving on UK Election night alone.
