It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \n**Presentation Title:** Making AI Agents Work For You (and Your Team)\n**Speaker:** Hannah Foxwell\nThis presentation explores the evolving role of AI agents in transforming workplaces and organizations. Hannah Foxwell emphasizes the potential of AI agents to drive change, while recognizing the need to critically evaluate traditional assumptions about productivity and organizational design.\n  * Forget the productivity arguments associated with AI agents. Instead, focus on doing the right work better, not just more work.\n  * AI agents should not replace humans but can effectively handle specific tasks. Teams of specialized agents can work together to deliver surprising results.\n  * _Design of agent teams:_ Utilizing multi-agent roles can lead to more efficient and focused outcomes. Ensuring specificity in tasks and maintaining a collaborative dynamic are key.\n  * The \"principle of least privilege\" should guide the integration of AI agents, ensuring each agent has only the required tools and responsibilities. Limiting tool access is crucial for effective agent performance.\n  * Feedback loops and human oversight remain vital in maintaining the quality, reliability, and safety of agents in real-world applications.\n  * AI agents can alleviate mundane repetitive tasks, freeing humans to focus on creative and novel efforts that offer direct value to customers.\n\n\nThe talk ends with a vision of AI agents as tools to enhance human capability, not to replace it, aimed at promoting sustainable business growth and a happier workforce.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nEveryone is talking about AI agents, autonomous programmes that can solve problems and work towards their goals independently. You can even have teams of agents working for you. But, is the anthropomorphism of AI a good thing? These are just computer programs after all?\nWe don\u2019t know what the future will look like, but we do know that the way we work is changing. When our work changes our teams change, and as our teams change our organisations will change. We\u2019re living through an age of experimentation and discovery, where we need to look at some of our assumptions about \u201cwhat good looks like\u201d and challenge if they\u2019re still valid.\nLet\u2019s get nerdy about org design and discuss how AI could change how we set ourselves up for success, whatever our mission.\nInterview\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nThis time last year I would have answered differently! Until 2024 my career has been focussed on building high performing software engineering teams but more recently I've been focussed on Generative AI and it's potential. At work I'm currently building high performing teams of AI Agents whilst also leading an new AI Community called \"AI for the rest of us\" aimed at creating a fun, supportive and accessible space to learn about AI.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nAt QCon last year I attended some of the AI talks and I was honestly bamboozled by new words and concepts. I don't want anyone to feel like that in my talk - My goal is to provide an introduction to AI agents and how they can be used in the real world!\n### Who is your talk for?\nMy talk is for everyone! Even if you're familiar with the technology this talk will help you take a new perspective on how AI Agents might reshape your work and your team!\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nIn my experience there's a lot of people talking about AI Agents but not enough people experimenting and building. I'd like to inspire people to try it and see what it can do! \n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nYes, I do indeed think Agentic AI is the next big disruption. I'm here for the rollercoaster!\n### What was one interesting thing that you learned from a previous QCon?\nLast year at QCon I googled the word inference during a talk about self-hosted LLMs!!! It's hard to believe how far I've come in just a year!!! \n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Hannah Foxwell\nIndependent Consultant at the Intersection of Platform Engineering, Security, and AI, Founder of AI For the Rest of Us\nWith over a decade of experience in platform engineering, Hannah Foxwell has always advocated for the human aspects of technology transformation and evolution.
