Now, carbon emission is joining their ranks as a golden signal in a world increasingly focused on sustainability. But how do we effectively monitor and manage this new dimension of software performance?\nIn this session, Sarah will explore the growing field of green software monitoring. We will review the existing landscape, the available metrics and formats, and the challenges associated with accurately gauging environmental impact.\nAdditionally, we'll draw parallels to familiar SRE principles and tools, providing you with practical strategies for overseeing and reducing your software's carbon footprint. You'll discover how to utilise existing tools and methodologies, interpret and utilise data even when imperfect, and ultimately foster sustainable software development through informed decision-making to lessen your environmental impact.\nJoin us to discover how to get started with green monitoring, unlock data-driven insights, and transform your approach to software sustainability.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Sarah (Chun-Wei) Hsu\nSRE @Goldman Sachs & Training Project Chair @Green Software Foundation, TechWomen100 Winner, Co-Author of \"Building Green Software\"\nSarah (Chun-Wei) Hsu is a recent TechWomen100 winner and a strong advocate for green, sustainable software.
