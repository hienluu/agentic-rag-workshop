This year, we're considering the full spectrum of meanings implied by \"architecture\", not just web-scale distributed systems. From the cloud to the client, we'll be deep diving into the engineering behind architectures that power our physical world, our technological world, our entertainment world and our future world!\n* * *\n### From this track\nSession architecture\n### Architecture in the Lead: Scaling Today, Shaping Tomorrow\nMonday Apr 7 / 10:35AM BST\nThe BBC\u2019s websites and apps handled well over 100 million visitors in 2024, with 40 million people arriving on UK Election night alone. That\u2019s a lot of scale for an architecture to handle, but it\u2019s just the beginning. \nMatthew Clark\nHead Of Architecture for the @BBC's Digital Products, 25+ Years Developing Online Software\nIan Arundale\nLead Architect for the @BBC's Digital Products, 20+ Years in Software Engineering\nArchitecture in the Lead: Scaling Today, Shaping Tomorrow\nSession augmented reality\n### Developing Meta's Orion AR Glasses\nMonday Apr 7 / 11:45AM BST\nMeta announced the Orion AR Glasses in September 2024. It is a time machine to demonstrate that it's possible to build an immersive augmented reality experience in a glasses form-factor. There were numerous technical challenges to make this a reality. \nJinsong Yu\nSoftware Engineer @Meta, Led the Development of Orion AR Glasses Software Stack, Previously @Google and @Microsoft\nDeveloping Meta's Orion AR Glasses\nSession\n### Connecting the Dots: Architectures (Limited Space - Registration Required)\nMonday Apr 7 / 01:35PM BST\nConnecting the Dots: Architectures (Limited Space - Registration Required)\nSession AWS serverless\n### Kraken's Serverless Architecture for Keeping the Grid Green\nMonday Apr 7 / 02:45PM BST\nThe green energy transition is real, and happening, but it needs technology to make it successful. Everything from renewable energy generation onto the grid, to how consumers use energy, needs technology to be effective and keep up with today's demands. \nKevin Bowman\nPlatform Engineering @KrakenTech (Octopus Energy), Previously @SkyBet and Others, Passionate About Removing Friction From Getting Stuff Successfully Into Production\nKraken's Serverless Architecture for Keeping the Grid Green\nSession\n### Fast Eventual Consistency: Inside Corrosion, the Distributed System Powering Fly.io\nMonday Apr 7 / 03:55PM BST\nThis talk explores Corrosion, an open-source solution built on SQLite that delivers fast, eventually consistent replication across distributed nodes. \nSomtochi Onyekwere\nSoftware Engineer @fly.io, Previously Developer Experience Engineer @Weaveworks\nFast Eventual Consistency: Inside Corrosion, the Distributed System Powering Fly.io\nSession AI/ML\n### Lessons Learned From Building LinkedIn\u2019s First Agent: Hiring Assistant\nMonday Apr 7 / 05:05PM BST\nIn October 2024, we announced LinkedIn\u2019s first agent, Hiring Assistant to a select group of LinkedIn customers. \nKarthik Ramgopal\nDistinguished Engineer & Tech Lead of the Product Engineering Team @LinkedIn, 15+ Years of Experience in Full-Stack Software Development \nDaniel Hewlett\nPrincipal AI Engineer & Technical Lead for AI @LinkedIn, 12+ Years of Expierence in ML and AI Engineering, Previously @Google\nLessons Learned From Building LinkedIn\u2019s First Agent: Hiring Assistant\n#### Track Host\n##### Ian Thomas\nSoftware Engineer @Meta, QCon London & San Francisco Co-Chair, International Speaker\n#### Date\nMonday Apr 7 / 10:35AM BST \n#### Share\nShare Share\n### Track Host\n#### Ian Thomas\nSoftware Engineer @Meta, QCon London & San Francisco Co-Chair, International Speaker\nIan's background is in Computer Science with a detour into UX and design.
