It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \n**Title:** Architecture in the Lead: Scaling Today, Shaping Tomorrow\n**Speakers:** Matthew Clark and Ian Arundale\n**Overview:** The presentation discusses how architecture can lead change within organizations by driving reliability, security, and growth at scale. The BBC's digital architecture handling over 100 million visitors annually is used as a case study.\n**Main Points:**\n  * **Time Travel Exercise:** An analogy used to reflect on past experiences and decisions shaping current architecture practices.\n  * **Architecture Challenges:**\n    * Handling large-scale traffic, exemplified by UK election night with over 40 million visitors.\n    * Addressing security as a primary focus, highlighting the threats from nation-states and hackers.\n    * The importance of resilience in critical moments, showcased by past election night challenges and learnings.\n  * **Architecture Strategies:**\n    * Using the cloud for elasticity and resilience, with examples of caching, serverless architecture, and content distribution networks.\n    * Implementing security through proactive threat modeling and integrating it early into the development process.\n\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):** Emphasizes the importance of NFRs in architecture, including elasticity, resilience, and security, and how they vary depending on the organizational context.\n**Conclusion:** The speakers conclude by stressing the role of architects as leaders who must adapt, influence, and inspire to implement effective architectural solutions.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nThe BBC\u2019s websites and apps handled well over 100 million visitors in 2024, with 40 million people arriving on UK Election night alone. That\u2019s a lot of scale for an architecture to handle, but it\u2019s just the beginning. True success comes not just from scaling to meet today\u2019s demand, but from shaping what comes next. In this talk, we\u2019ll explore how architecture can lead change in an organisation, driving reliability, security, and growth at scale. We\u2019ll look at approaches to influence decisions, set the technical vision, and guide organizations to ride the wave of technological change, continuing to innovate long after the first 100 million arrive.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Matthew Clark\nHead Of Architecture for the @BBC's Digital Products, 25+ Years Developing Online Software\nMatthew Clark is Head of Architecture for many of the BBC\u2019s online products.
