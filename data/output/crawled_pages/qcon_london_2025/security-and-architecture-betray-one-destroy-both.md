It is experimental, and feedback is welcomed. Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \nThe presentation titled \"Security and Architecture: To Betray One Is To Destroy Both\" by Shana Dacres-Lawrence explores the intricate relationship between security and architecture, emphasizing the critical need for aligning the two domains to prevent systemic vulnerabilities.\n**Key Themes:**\n  * _Historical Context:_ Initially, architecture and security were seen as separate entities, with architecture focusing on functionality and security on compliance.\n  * _Evolution:_ With the rise of internet threats in the early 2000s, both fields began integrating more deeply, adopting practices like secure by design.\n  * _Current Integration:_ Modern systems embrace concepts like zero trust and DevSecOps, creating a collaborative environment where security and architecture support each other\u2019s values.\n\n\n**Betrayal Types:**\n  * _Physical Betrayal:_ Includes structural weaknesses such as misconfiguration and prioritizing speed over security, leading to incidents like the CrowdStrike outage affecting millions.\n  * _Emotional Betrayal:_ Stems from assumed loyalty and lack of communication, as seen in issues like Barclays' system glitches affecting customer transactions.\n  * _Trust Betrayal:_ Involves assumed security compliance, exemplified by the Change Healthcare data breach, revealing gaps due to integration assumptions.\n\n\n**Defense Strategies:**\n  1. **Open Communication:** Building trust through clear, consistent communication between teams.\n  2. **Tools and Technology:** Implementing frameworks and technologies that seamlessly integrate and enhance both domains.\n  3. **Automation:** Establishing automated processes for security compliance and testing.\n  4. **Hands-On Validation:** Conducting direct tests such as penetration testing to ensure systems meet security objectives.\n  5. **Collaborative Culture:** Encouraging a culture of empathy and understanding by involving both domains in decision-making processes.\n\n\nThis presentation advocates for proactive measures and collaborative strategies to prevent betrayals, emphasizing that architecture should shape security, while security guides architecture to create resilient, adaptable systems.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nFlawed architecture introduces vulnerabilities that even the best security cannot mitigate. Likewise, a well-architected system without robust security remains a ticking time bomb in the face of modern threats. In this talk, I will explore how these two domains shape one another, how public demand for transparency has raised the stakes, and how aligning architecture and security is critical in an era of rapid innovation.\nThis talk will guide your thinking on how to uphold both security and architecture without betraying either. We will explore methods to ensure they remain consistent, coherent, and complementary, supporting each other in achieving the desired outcomes and safeguarding against the destruction of both.\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nDesigning secure, resilient systems of critical national importance.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nMy experience over the years working in roles such as security architect and a solution architect, where I\u2019ve witnessed firsthand the challenges that arise at the intersection of these disciplines. I\u2019ve seen how betraying one weakens the other, leading to compromised designs. This talk is my effort to share insights and strategies to bridge that gap, fostering a stronger, more unified approach to architecture and security.\n### Who is your talk for?\nEveryone, especially those who are dedicated to designing, building, and maintaining robust solutions.\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nWith actionable strategies for safeguarding the inseparable union of architecture and security, understanding that neglecting this critical relationship can lead to devastating consequences.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nQuantum computing \n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Shana Dacres-Lawrence\nSenior Principal Architect @6point6 | Part of Accenture, Founder for ArchitectHer\nShana is an accomplished Senior Architect with over 12 years of experience and a strong foundation in Cyber Security and Software development.
