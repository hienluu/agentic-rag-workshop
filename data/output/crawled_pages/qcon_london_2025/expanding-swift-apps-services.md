This session will explore why Swift is a great fit for services development, from memory safety to interoperability with other languages. Finally, we\u2019ll discuss some of the principles we use when writing services in Swift at Apple.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Cory Benfield\nSenior Software Engineer Doing Swift on Server @Apple\nCory is a serial open source contributor and maintainer with more than a decade of experience building, maintaining, and innovating open source networking frameworks and protocol libraries. Currently Cory is a Senior Software Engineer at Apple, putting his skills to use on high-performance networking frameworks such as SwiftNIO, Netty, and more.\nRead more\n#### Speaker\n##### Cory Benfield\nSenior Software Engineer Doing Swift on Server @Apple\n#### Date\nTuesday Apr 8 / 11:45AM BST ( 50 minutes )\n#### Location\nWindsor (5th Fl.)\n#### Track\nMemory Safe Native Languages and WASM\n#### Topics\nservices swift memory safety privacy\n#### Video\nVideo is not available\n#### Slides\nSlides are not available\n#### Share\nShare Share\n## From the same track\nSession Startup\n### Questioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\nTuesday Apr 8 / 10:35AM BST\nAre you considering founding a startup? What stack would you use? Would you take a bet on a programming language you've never used professionally before? When building a company from scratch, these aren\u2019t just theoretical questions \u2013 they\u2019re make-or-break decisions with real consequences. \nSam Cox\nCo-Founder & CTO @Tracebit, Building Security Canaries at Scale\nQuestioning Convention: C# as a Shortcut to Startup Velocity\nSession WASM\n### WASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nTuesday Apr 8 / 01:35PM BST\nWebAssembly (WASM) is emerging as a powerful tool beyond its browser origins, enabling safer, more flexible, and more efficient execution across a wide range of enterprise applications.In this session, we\u2019ll take a hands-on look at real-world use cases, including: \nAndrea Peruffo\nOpen Source Addicted Software Developer @RedHat, Passionate About Distributed Systems, Compilers, Infrastructure and Everything In Between\nWASM in the Enterprise: Secure, Portable, and Ready for Business\nSession WebAssembly\n### How WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nTuesday Apr 8 / 02:45PM BST\nApplication extensions are an essential part of any software ecosystem. While Rust is a great language, its lack of a standard ABI means that the whole source code has to be available to the compiler. \nAlex Radovici\nOperating Systems & Compilers PhD, Author of \"Getting Started with Secure Embedded Systems\" and Core Contributor of Tock OS\nHow WebAssembly Components Enable Safe and Portable Software Extensions\nSession\n### WASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nTuesday Apr 8 / 05:05PM BST\nWhy would you build your own Function as a Service platform and what does a FaaS architecture look like? Building something that can scale to zero, work with your existing systems, stay secure, and handle different workloads isn\u2019t easy. \nLaurent Doguin\nDirector Developer Relations & Strategy @couchbase, Previously Developer Advocate @Clever Cloud and @Nuxeo\nWASM Components are a FaaS' Best Friend\nSession\n### Unconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\nTuesday Apr 8 / 03:55PM BST\nUnconference: Memory Safe Native Languages and WASM\n"
