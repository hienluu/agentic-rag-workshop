Please reach out to info@qconlondon.com with any comments or concerns. \n**Title:** Holistic Engineering: Organic Problem Solving for Complex Evolving Systems\n**Speaker:** Vanessa Formicola\n**Overview:**\nVanessa Formicola, an experienced Principal Engineer, discussed _holistic engineering_ , emphasizing the integration of technical and non-technical factors in system design. This approach considers how various external and internal forces influence the development and functionality of software systems.\n  * **Background:** Vanessa introduced herself and outlined her varied experiences across different roles and companies, highlighting recurring patterns of problems in technology projects.\n  * **Holistic Engineering Concept:** The methodology promotes considering all factors\u2014external events, organizational structures, human elements\u2014when designing and managing software systems.\n  * **Strategies for Implementation:**\n    * Identify and make explicit the various forces impacting the system.\n    * Create models and visualizations to understand complex interactions within the system.\n    * Socialize findings and insights across the organization to foster collective understanding and improvements.\n  * **Project Challenges:** Vanessa explored common project pitfalls, such as late deliveries due to unforeseen constraints, and the importance of understanding the social dynamics within organizations.\n  * **Case Studies and Examples:** Examples were provided to illustrate how external and internal factors affect technical decisions and project outcomes.\n\n\n**Conclusion:** Emphasizing a holistic approach helps in recognizing the interconnectedness of various elements within the software development ecosystem, allowing for more resilient and adaptable systems.\nThis is the end of the AI-generated content.\n* * *\n### Abstract\nEvery day developers have to work with code influenced by past decisions made by non-technical departments. Every day there are defects and other obstacles caused by non-technical factors that are nonetheless reflected in your code. Isn\u2019t it time we make the implicit explicit, and embrace the organic, evolving nature of our software?\nIn this talk I will share many experiences I have had with such problems. I will draw out the common factors that underpinned these difficulties, describing not only how they presented in code, but also the causes that led to them. I will introduce Holistic Engineering, the practice of designing tech thinking of all the intrinsic parts of the organic system, embracing how people, management, organizational structure, budgets, company goals, production vision, security and even the political climate impact directly your code. This talk will help you better understand the boundaries of the organic system you are making technical decisions for and apply strategies to incorporate technical and non-technical factors to your decision process for your ever evolving organic system.\n## Interview:\n### What is the focus of your work?\nSolving problems. I aim to evolve the system I am working on towards the best outcome we can realistically achieve, influencing or taking into consideration all the variables of the system: human, technical, organizational, relationships, culture and the point in time.\n### What\u2019s the motivation for your talk?\nSeeing so many projects not achieve their potential successful outcome due to the lack of understanding of variables that are not technical.\n### Who is your talk for?\nArchitects, Staff+ engineers, technical leaders and anyone in engineering or from a different department with the responsibility to make difficult decisions under real constraints.\n### What do you want someone to walk away with from your presentation?\nTo get over themselves and embrace the idea that in order to have the best project outcome and architecture you need to factor in your decision process a much larger set of variables than just the technical ones.\n### What do you think is the next big disruption in software?\nEthical engineering. I think in the upcoming years we will focus a lot more on how the choices we make in software will impact the world around us at that point in time and in the future. In order to be able to do so, we need to embrace being part of a bigger system than our engineering department and work on solving problems holistically.\n* * *\n### Speaker\n#### Vanessa Formicola\nPrincipal Engineer @FloHealth, Ex Thoughtworks & Microsoft, Community Builder and Social Change Advocate\nPrincipal Engineer at Flo, ~15 years of industry experience (Microsoft/ThoughtWorks) and 5+ years in leadership roles.
