        "question": "Why does the \"local first\" design principle prioritize the user's device as the primary source of truth, and how does this choice mitigate the risks associated with an acquihire or the loss of a proprietary server infrastructure?",
        "answer": "Local\u2011first software treats the device as the authoritative data store so that the application can continue to operate even when the remote server disappears. By keeping the core state locally, users are not dependent on a private, company\u2011owned backend that could be shut down, sold, or abandoned after an acquihire. This design eliminates the single point of failure that traditional networked apps have, ensuring that the app remains functional and that users retain control over their data, which is the central problem the talk highlights.",

        "question": "What are the primary technical trade\u2011offs introduced by adopting a local\u2011first architecture\u2014particularly regarding authentication, data synchronization, and schema management\u2014and how might these challenges be addressed according to the speaker\u2019s discussion?",
        "answer": "Adopting a local\u2011first model shifts complexity from the server to the client. Authentication must work without a central authority, requiring decentralized or federated identity schemes. Data synchronization becomes a peer\u2011to\u2011peer problem, needing conflict\u2011free replicated data types (CRDTs) or similar mechanisms to merge divergent changes safely. Schema management must handle evolving data models across devices that may be offline for long periods, demanding versioned schemas and migration strategies. The speaker points to ongoing research and tools like the Automerge CRDT library as viable solutions, indicating that while these challenges are non\u2011trivial, they are being actively addressed.",
