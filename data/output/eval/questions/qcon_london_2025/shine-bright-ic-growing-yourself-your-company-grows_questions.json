        "question": "Why does Suhail stress the importance of investing in organizational relationships and extracurricular activities (e.g., hiring, mentoring, community building) for reaching Staff+/Principal levels, rather than relying solely on deep technical mastery?",
        "answer": "Suhail argues that technical mastery alone is insufficient for senior individual\u2011contributor roles because advancement also requires influence, communication, and strategic thinking. Building relationships lets engineers become leaders who can unblock key projects, shape business outcomes, and address \"organizational cracks\" before they become entrenched problems. Extracurricular activities such as hiring and mentoring demonstrate leadership, expand one\u2019s network inside and outside the company, and signal a broader impact on the organization\u2014qualities that are essential for Staff/Principal engineers who must drive both technical and cultural change.",

        "question": "How does the notion of \u201corganizational cracks\u201d shape Suhail\u2019s recommendation that engineering leaders prioritize people networks over code and systems, and what trade\u2011offs might arise when focusing on root\u2011cause cultural issues instead of delivering immediate technical solutions?",
        "answer": "The concept of \"organizational cracks\" refers to underlying people\u2011related problems that, if ignored, become tolerated and hinder progress. Suhail suggests that because code and infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, micro\u2011services) are transient, lasting impact comes from strong networks and addressing these cracks at their root. Prioritizing people networks means investing time in mentorship, cross\u2011team communication, and community building, which can delay short\u2011term feature delivery but yields longer\u2011term stability, faster unblock\u2011ing of projects, and better alignment with business goals. The trade\u2011off is a temporary reduction in pure engineering output for a more resilient, collaborative organization that can sustain growth.",
