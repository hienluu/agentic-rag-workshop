        "question": "Why does the speaker of \u201cKraken's Serverless Architecture for Keeping the Grid Green\u201d promote a serverless design for renewable\u2011energy grid management, and what are the key trade\u2011offs of using serverless in a high\u2011throughput, latency\u2011sensitive environment like the power grid?",
        "answer": "The speaker argues that a serverless approach aligns with the green\u2011energy goal because it automatically scales to match fluctuating demand, eliminates the need for always\u2011on servers (reducing idle power consumption), and shifts operational overhead to the cloud provider, allowing engineers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure. These benefits translate into lower carbon footprints and cost efficiency. However, serverless introduces trade\u2011offs: cold\u2011start latency can affect real\u2011time grid\u2011control loops; reduced visibility and control over the underlying hardware can make fine\u2011tuned performance optimisations harder; reliance on a single cloud vendor may create lock\u2011in; and guaranteeing the ultra\u2011low latency and deterministic behavior required for grid stability may be more challenging than with dedicated, provisioned resources.",

        "question": "How does building Corrosion on top of SQLite shape its consistency model and performance, and why might the designers have chosen an eventually\u2011consistent replication strategy instead of strong consistency for Fly.io\u2019s distributed platform?",
        "answer": "SQLite provides a lightweight, ACID\u2011compliant local datastore that can be embedded directly in each node, giving fast local reads and writes with minimal overhead. By using SQLite as the storage engine, Corrosion can replicate changes quickly without the heavyweight coordination required by traditional distributed databases. The designers therefore adopted an eventually\u2011consistent model, which avoids the need for a global consensus protocol, reduces cross\u2011node latency, and improves throughput\u2014critical for Fly.io\u2019s globally distributed workloads where low latency is paramount. Strong consistency would impose additional round\u2011trips and coordination cost, hurting performance and user\u2011experience, while many of Fly.io\u2019s use cases can tolerate brief periods of divergence, making eventual consistency a pragmatic trade\u2011off between consistency guarantees and system responsiveness.",
